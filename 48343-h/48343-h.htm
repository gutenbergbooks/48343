<h2>NOTE.</h2>


<p>Clergymen and Doctors are so frequently associated,
in connection with the most pleasant and the most
grave necessities and occurrences of actual life, that
if any apology is needed for uniting them on the present
occasion, it is only because the abundant fund of
anecdote and interest relating to both professions
can therefore be drawn upon to the smaller extent.
In this, as in the other volumes of this little series,
the only plan followed has been that of striving to
be brief and interesting in each selection or summary.
Much of the charm and value of a collection of this
kind consists in the large admixture of personal incident,
and liberal display of individual character&mdash;which
the nature and duties of the clerical and medical
professions render so easy. But it has also been
sought to present, not of course in order or in complete
series, a number of such curious facts as throw
a side-light at once on professional and social history;
and it is confidently hoped that thus the collection
will not only amuse, but inform.</p>

SKETCHES.</i></p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3>SIR ASTLEY COOPER'S NIGHTCAP FEE.</h3>


<p>Living as he long did in the City,&mdash;in Broad Street,&mdash;Sir
Astley Cooper, the most distinguished surgeon of
his time, made a very large income; which, however,
naturally enough rose and fell somewhat in sympathy
with the state of the markets. In one year he made
20,000 guineas; and for many years his income was
over £15,000. From one Mincing Lane merchant,
whom he usually visited at Croydon, Sir Astley derived
for a long period an annual revenue of £600.
Large individual fees, of course, were also paid by the
wealthy traders and financiers on special occasions;
and once, and once only, Sir Astley received&mdash;and
received in a very whimsical fashion&mdash;the splendid
<em>honorarium</em> of a thousand guineas. A West Indian
millionaire, of the name of Hyatt, during a painful
and critical operation which he had to undergo, was
attended by Drs. Lettsom and Nelson as physicians,
and by Sir Astley Cooper as surgeon. The operation
was successful, and the patient speedily felt in himself
the promise of recovered health and spirits. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
did not wait for his complete recovery to evince his
sense of gratitude and joy; but promptly rewarded
his physicians with a fee of 300 guineas each. "As
for you, Sir," the millionaire said, sitting up in bed
and addressing himself to Sir Astley,&mdash;"you, Sir,
shall have something better than that; there, Sir,
take that!"&mdash;and he flung his nightcap at the great
surgeon. Sir Astley picked up the nightcap, saying,
"Sir, I pocket the affront;" and on reaching home
he found in the cap a cheque for 1000 guineas. In
his younger days, however, Sir Astley Cooper had
sowed, by anxious and ill-rewarded waiting, the seeds
of his subsequent great renown and revenue: in his
first year of practice his profits were but five guineas;
in his second, twenty-six pounds; in his third, thirty-four;
and only in the ninth year did his income mount
above a thousand pounds.</p>


<h3>ELOQUENCE OF MASSILLON.</h3>

<p>Jean Baptiste Massillon, born in 1663 at Hyères,
was one of the greatest pulpit orators of France. At
the age of seventeen he entered the congregation of
the Oratory, at Paris, and won very high favour;
but, being enviously accused of some amours, he went
into retirement for a short time. The eloquence by
which his funeral sermon, at his retirement at St.
Fonds, on the Archbishop de Villars was characterized,
led to his reluctant but triumphant return to Paris.
The applause with which his oratory met there, even
at the Court, was almost unparalleled. When he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
preached the first Advent sermon at Versailles, Louis
XIV. paid the following most happy and expressive
testimony to the power of his preaching: "Father,
when I hear other preachers, I am very well satisfied
with them; when I hear you, I am dissatisfied
with myself." The effect of his first delivery of the
sermon "On the small number of the Elect," has been
described as almost miraculous. At a certain powerful
passage in it, the entire auditory was seized with
such violent emotion, that almost every person half
rose from his seat, as if to endeavour to shake off the
horror of being one of those cast out into everlasting
darkness. He spoke with that strong, earnest simplicity
which is the surest key to the hearts of all
but the utterly devoid of feeling. When asked once
where a man like him, whose life was dedicated to
retirement, could borrow his admirable descriptions
of real life, he answered, "From the human heart;
let us examine it ever so slightly, we find in it the
seeds of every passion. When I compose a sermon,
I imagine myself consulted upon some difficult piece
of business. I give my whole application to determine
the person who has recourse to me to act the
good and proper part. I exhort him, I urge him,
and I quit him not until he has yielded to my persuasions."</p>


<h3>ADDISON'S INTRODUCTION TO BAXTER.</h3>

<p>Addison says that he once met with a page of Mr.
Baxter under a Christmas pie. "Whether or no the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
pastry-cook had made use of it through chance or
waggery, for the defence of that superstitious <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">viande</i>,
I know not; but, upon the perusal of it, I conceived
so good an idea of the author's piety that I bought
the whole book."</p>


<h3>THE PARTNERSHIP OF HUNTER AND CULLEN.</h3>

<p>Dr. William Cullen, the celebrated physician and
medical writer, and Dr. William Hunter, the brother
of the great anatomist, when young men formed
a copartnery of as singular and noble a nature as
any to be found in the records of their profession.
They were both natives of the neighbourhood of
Glasgow, and Hunter studied for the church at that
university. But he accidentally became acquainted
with Cullen, who was some years his senior, and had
settled in a medical practice at Hamilton; and this
friendship, strengthening his natural inclination, drew
Hunter away from the study of theology to that of
medicine. He went to reside with Cullen, and entered
into partnership with him&mdash;neither of the
young men being well to do, and both stimulated by
the impulse of genius to take this step in order that
they might the better overcome the obstacles presented
by the narrowness of their fortunes to the
prosecution of their studies. It was stipulated that
each partner alternately should be allowed to study
during the winter at what college he pleased, the
other meantime conducting the joint business for the
common advantage. Cullen, as the senior partner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
had the first winter, and he went to Edinburgh.
But next winter Hunter's turn came: he preferred
London to Edinburgh, went thither, and did not
return to Scotland. His excellence as a dissector,
singular dexterity in making anatomical preparations,
assiduity in study, and agreeable manners, won him
the warm regard of Dr. Douglas, to whom he had an
introduction from Foulis the printer; and in two or
three years Hunter became a lecturer on anatomy,
and laid the foundations of a great fame and fortune.
The scientific partnership was of course dissolved
by Hunter's success in London; but Cullen
freely consented to renounce his claim on his junior,
and ever afterwards maintained a very cordial and
friendly correspondence with Hunter&mdash;though the
two friends are believed never afterwards to have
seen each other.</p>


<h3>THE EXHAUSTIVE BARROW.</h3>

<p>Charles II., in his humorous fashion, was wont to
say about his chaplain&mdash;that distinguished philosopher
and divine, Dr. Isaac Barrow&mdash;that he was the
most unfair preacher in England, because he exhausted
every subject, and left no room for others
to come after him. This was indeed too much the
doctor's characteristic; when he had once got hold
of a topic, he knew not how to leave anything unsaid
upon it. One of his best discourses, on the
duty and reward of bounty to the poor, actually
occupied between three and four hours in the delivery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Although, however, his sermons are unusually long,
they so abound in matter, that his language sometimes
labours in the utterance of his thought; hence
his style is at times involved and parenthetical,
though passages of sublime and simple eloquence
frequently occur. It is related that, in preaching the
Spital sermon before the Lord Mayor and Corporation,
he consumed three hours and a half. Being asked,
after he came down from the pulpit, if he was not
tired, he replied, "Yes, indeed, I begin to be weary
in standing so long."</p>


<h3>A POPULAR PREACHER.</h3>

<p>When Father Thomas Conecte, who was afterwards
burnt at Rome, preached in the great towns of Flanders
and Artois, the churches were so filled that he
used to be hoisted in the middle of the church by a
cord, in order to be heard!</p>


<h3>"ATTERBURY'S PAD."</h3>

<p>During the debates on the Occasional Conformity
and Schism Bills, in the House of Lords, in December
1718, these measures were very warmly opposed by
Atterbury, Bishop of Rochester; who said "he had
prophesied last winter that this bill would be attempted
in the next session, and he was very sorry
to find that he had turned out a true prophet."
Lord Coningsby, who always spoke in a passion,
rose immediately after Atterbury, and remarked that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
"one of the right reverends had set himself forth as
a prophet; but, for his part, he did not know what
prophet to liken him to, unless to that famous prophet
Balaam, who was reproved by his own ass."
The Bishop, in reply, with great calmness and wit
met the attack of Lord Coningsby, thus concluding:
"Since the noble Lord has discovered in our manners
such a similitude, I am well content to be compared
to the prophet Balaam; but, my Lords, I am at a
loss to make out the other part of the parallel. I
am sure that I have been <em>reproved by nobody but his
Lordship</em>." From that day forward, Lord Coningsby
was known by the sobriquet of "Atterbury's Pad."</p>


<h3>THE FOOT-SCRAPERS REPROVED.</h3>

<p>When a preacher was very obnoxious to the students
at Cambridge, it was the custom for them to express
disapprobation by scraping with their feet on the
floor. A very eloquent but intriguing preacher, Dr.
James Scott&mdash;known as a political partisan by the
pamphleteer and newspaper signatures of "Anti-Sejanus"
and "Old Slyboots"&mdash;being one day saluted
thus, signified his intention to preach against the
practice of scraping; and fulfilled his promise very
shortly afterwards, taking for his text, "Keep thy
foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be
more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools;
for they consider not that they do evil." On the text
being read out, the galleries became one scene of
confusion and uproar; but Dr. Scott called to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
proctors to preserve silence. This being effected, he
delivered a discourse so eloquent, as to extort universal
approbation, even from those at whom the text
was aimed.</p>


<h3>A PRESCRIPTION IN DISGUISE.</h3>

<p>General D&mdash;&mdash; was more distinguished for gallantry
in the field than for the care he lavished upon his
person. Complaining, on a certain occasion, to Chief
Justice Bushe, of Ireland, of the sufferings he endured
from rheumatism, that learned and humorous
judge undertook to prescribe a remedy. "You must
desire your servant," he said to the General, "to place
every morning by your bedside a tub three-parts
filled with warm water. You will then get into the
tub, and having previously provided yourself with a
pound of yellow soap, you must rub your whole
body with it, immersing yourself occasionally in the
water, and at the end of a quarter of an hour, the
process concludes by wiping yourself dry with towels,
and scrubbing your person with a flesh-brush."
"Why," said the General, after reflecting for a
minute or two, "this seems to be neither more nor
less than washing one's self." "Well, I must confess,"
rejoined the judge, "<em>it is open to that objection</em>."</p>


<h3>HOW TO DRESS A CUCUMBER.</h3>

<p>Dr. Glynn, of Cambridge, being one day in attendance
on a lady, in the quality of her physician, took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
occasion to lecture her on the impropriety of eating
cucumbers, of which she was immoderately fond; and
gave her the following humorous receipt for dressing
them: "Peel the cucumber with great care; then
cut it into very thin slices; pepper and salt it well&mdash;and
then throw it away."</p>


<h3>GILPIN AND THE NORTHUMBRIAN BRAWLERS.</h3>

<p>Bernard Gilpin, the great Northern apostle, did
not confine his labours to the church of Houghton-le-Spring,
of which he was minister; but at his own
expense, and with great risk and hardship, visited the
then desolate churches of Northumberland once every
year, usually about Christmas, to preach the gospel.
The Northumbrians about that time retained so much
of the customs of our Saxon ancestors, as to decide
every dispute by the sword; they even went beyond
them, and, not content with a duel, each contending
party used to muster what adherents he could, and
began a kind of petty war, so that a private grudge
would often occasion much bloodshed. In one of his
annual tours, Mr. Gilpin found a quarrel of this kind
raging at Rothbury. During the first two or three
days of his preaching, the contending parties observed
some decorum, and never came to church both at
the same time. At last, however, they met; one
party had come early, and just as Mr. Gilpin began
the sermon the other entered. They did not stand
long quiet, but, mutually enraged at the sight of each
other, began to clash their arms. Awed, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
by the sacredness of the place, the tumult somewhat
fell, and Mr. Gilpin could proceed with his sermon.
In a short time, however, the combatants anew
brandished their weapons, and approached each other.
Mr. Gilpin now came down from the pulpit, went
between the two parties, and, appealing to the chiefs,
stayed the quarrel for the time, though he could not
perfectly reconcile them. They promised that until
the sermon was over there should be no further disturbance.
Mr. Gilpin then remounted the pulpit,
and devoted the rest of the time to endeavour to
make the combatants ashamed of their behaviour;
and his courage and earnestness so much affected
them, that at his further entreaty they agreed to
abstain from all acts of hostility while he continued
in the country. Another time, when he entered the
church, Mr. Gilpin saw a glove hanging up, and was
told by the sexton that it was as a challenge to any
one that should take it down. The sexton refusing
to take it down, because he "dared not," Mr. Gilpin
procured a long staff, took it down himself, and put
it in his breast. When the congregation assembled,
he went into the pulpit, and took occasion severely
to rebuke these inhuman challenges, and especially
this fashion of hanging up the glove in church.
"I hear," said he, "that there is one among you
who even in this sacred place hath hanged up a glove
to this purpose, and threateneth to enter into combat
with whosoever shall take it down. Behold, I
have taken it down myself!" and, plucking the glove
out of his breast, he held it up before them all, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
again proceeded to condemn such barbarous fashions,
and to commend the practice of love and charity. So
much did his faithfulness win for him respect, and
soften the stern mood of the country folk, that so
often as he came into the parts where he had administered
these rebukes, if any man was in fear of
a deadly foe, he resorted usually where Mr. Gilpin
was, supposing himself to be more safe in his company
than under an armed guard.</p>


<h3>MASSES TRANSFERRED.</h3>

<p>Bernal Diaz relates, that while Cortes was absent
on his expedition against Christoval d'Oli, his death
was reported by men who assumed the government
at Mexico; they ordered ceremonies and masses for
his soul, and paid for them with his effects. When
he returned in safety, Juan de Caceres, "the rich,"
bought all these acts of devotion for his own benefit&mdash;like
some modern buyer of shares, expecting a regular
entry of the transfer to be made in the books of the
concern in which he invested.</p>


<h3>PRECEPT AND EXAMPLE OF ABSTINENCE.</h3>

<p>John Wesley having learned that a wealthy tradesman
of his neighbourhood indulged to excess in the
pleasures of the table, paid him a visit, and, discussing
the subject with him, urged every argument and
every passage of Scripture he could against the sin
of gluttony. Observing the tradesman silent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
thoughtful, Wesley flattered himself that he had
gained his point and produced the desired reformation.
The dinner cloth was by this time spread, and
sumptuous elegance decorated the board. Mr. Wesley
was asked to dine; and having consented, was
thus addressed by his host: "Sir, your conversation
has made such an impression on me, that henceforward
I shall live only on bread and water; and
to show you that I am in good earnest, I will begin
immediately." The dinner was then ordered to be
removed, and bread and water introduced; to the
disappointment of the preacher, who, although an
abstemious man, wished for something better than an
anchorite's fare.</p>


<h3>QUEEN ELIZABETH'S BLOOD JEWELS.</h3>

<p>In the <cite>Parliamentary History</cite>, under date of 1601,
the Lord Keeper is reported to say: "I have seen
her Majesty wear at her girdle the price of her blood;
I mean, jewels which have been given to her physicians
to have done that unto her which I hope God
will ever keep from her. But she hath rather worn
them in triumph, than for the price, which hath not
been greatly valuable."</p>


<h3>THE POWER OF TAR-WATER.</h3>

<p>Doctor Hill, a notorious wit, physician, and man of
letters, having quarrelled with the members of the
Royal Society, who had refused to admit him as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
associate, resolved to avenge himself. At the time
that Bishop Berkeley had issued his work on the
marvellous virtues of tar-water, Hill addressed to
their secretary a letter, purporting to be from a
country surgeon, and reciting the particulars of a
cure which he had effected. "A sailor," he wrote,
"broke his leg, and applied to me for help. I bound
together the broken portions, and washed them with
the celebrated tar-water. Almost immediately the
sailor felt the beneficial effects of this remedy, and
it was not long before his leg was completely healed!"
The letter was read and discussed at the meetings of
the Royal Society, and caused considerable difference
of opinion. Papers were written for and against the
tar-water and the restored leg, when a second letter
arrived from the (pretended) country practitioner:
"In my last I omitted to mention that the broken
limb of the sailor was a wooden leg!"</p>


<h3>THE CURATE AND THE DUKE.</h3>

<p>The Duke of Grafton, when hunting, was thrown
into a ditch; at the same time a young curate, calling
out, "Lie still, your Grace," leaped over him, and
pursued his sport. On being assisted to remount by
his attendants, the duke said, "That young man
shall have the first good living that falls to my disposal;
had he stopped to have taken care of me, I
never would have patronised him"&mdash;being delighted
with an ardour similar to his own, and with a spirit
that would not stoop to flatter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>


<h3>A LOYAL AND FATAL PRAYER.</h3>

<p>It is related by Thoresby that Mr. John Jackson, a
good old Puritan, and a member of the Assembly
of Divines at Westminster, "was yet so zealously
affected for King Charles I., when he heard of his
being brought before a pretended high court of justice,
that he prayed earnestly that God would please to
prevent that horrid act, which would be a perpetual
shame to the nation, and a reproach to the Protestant
religion; or, at least, would be pleased to remove
him, that he might not see the woful day. His prayer
was heard and answered as to himself, for he was
buried the week before" the execution of Charles took
place.</p>


<h3>FLAVEL'S "DAY OF HEAVEN."</h3>

<p>This distinguished Nonconformist divine, who lived
about the end of the seventeenth century, in his
<cite>Treatise on the Soul of Man</cite> relates of himself&mdash;so
at least it is understood, though he speaks in
the third person&mdash;that for a day he was wrapt in
such intimate spiritual communion with heaven, as
exhausted the powers of physical nature, and for a
time appeared to leave him on the brink of the
grave. This singular season of trance he used to
style "one of the days of heaven;" and he affirmed,
that in that time there came to him more insight
into the heavenly life, than he had all his days gained
from books or sermons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Being on a journey, he set himself to improve
his time by meditation; when his mind grew intent,
till at length he had such ravishing tastes of heavenly
joys, and such full assurance of his interest therein,
that he utterly lost the sight and sense of this world
and all its concerns, so that for hours he knew
not where he was. At last, perceiving himself faint
through a great loss of blood from his nose, he
alighted from his horse, and sat down at a spring,
where he washed and refreshed himself, earnestly
desiring, if it were the will of God, that he might
then leave the world. His spirits reviving, he finished
his journey in the same delightful frame. He passed
all that night without a wink of sleep, the joy of the
Lord still overflowing him, so that he seemed an
inhabitant of the other world." It was taken by his
religious friends as a special promise of heavenly
favour, that at the birth of Flavel a pair of nightingales
made their nest close to the chamber of his
mother, and welcomed him into the world with their
delightful warble.</p>


<h3>A ROYAL MEDICINE.</h3>

<p>Even so late as the days of Queen Elizabeth, ignorance
and superstition continued prime regulating
powers in the practice of physic; accomplished as
some of the physicians of the day were, it was, as
Lord Bacon has affirmed, in every department excepting
those that immediately touched their own
profession. Sir William Bulleyn was not one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
least prominent and enlightened; but some of the
prescriptions which he has left on record, attest a
very deplorable state of things, existing little more
than half a century before Harvey achieved his great
discovery. Take for example this recipe for an</p>


<p class="center">"<i>Electuarium de Gemmis.</i>"</p>

<p>"Take two drachms of white perles; two little
peeces of saphyre; jacinth, corneline, emerauldes,
granettes, of each an ounce; setwal, the sweate
roote doronike, the rind of pomecitron, mace, basel
seede, of each two drachms; of redde corall, amber,
shaving of ivory, of each two drachms; rootes both
of white and red behen, ginger, long peper, spicknard,
folium indicum, saffron, cardamon, of each one
drachm; of troch. diarodon, lignum aloes, of each
half a small handful; cinnamon, galinga, zurubeth,
which is a kind of setwal, of each one drachm and a
half; thin pieces of gold and sylver, of each half
a scruple; of musk, half a drachm. Make your
electuary with honey emblici, which is the fourth
kind of mirobalans with roses, strained in equall
partes, as much as will suffice. This healeth cold
diseases of ye braine, harte, stomack. It is a medicine
proved against the tremblynge of the harte,
faynting and souning, the weaknes of the stomacke,
pensivenes, solitarines. Kings and noble men have
used this for their comfort. It causeth them to be
bold-spirited, the body to smell wel, and ingendreth
to the face good coloure."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>


<h3>A SIGNIFICANT INTERPOLATION.</h3>

<p>The most celebrated wits and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon vivants</i> of the day
graced the dinner table of Dr. Kitchener, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter
aliis</i> George Colman, who was an especial favourite.
His interpolation of a little monosyllable in a written
admonition, which the Doctor caused to be placed on
the mantlepiece of the dining parlour, will never be
forgotten, and was the origin of such a drinking bout
as was seldom permitted under his roof. The caution
ran thus: "Come at seven, go at eleven." Colman
briefly altered the sense of it; for, upon the Doctor's
attention being directed to the card, he read, to his
astonishment, "Come at seven, <em>go it</em> at eleven!"
which the guests did, and the claret was punished
accordingly.</p>


<h3>THE SEAMAN-BISHOP.</h3>

<p>Dr. Lyons, who was appointed to the Bishopric of
Cork, Cloyne, and Ross, towards the end of the reign
of Queen Elizabeth, held the See for twenty years,
but only preached once&mdash;on the death of the Queen.
His aversion to preaching is ascribed to the fact that
he was not educated for the church. He was, indeed,
captain of a ship, and distinguished himself so
gallantly in several actions with the Spaniards, that,
on his being introduced to the Queen, she told him
that he should have the first vacancy that offered.
The simple captain understood the Queen literally;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and soon after, hearing of a vacancy in the See of
Cork, he immediately set out for Court, and claimed
the fulfilment of the royal promise. The Queen,
astonished at the request, for a time remonstrated
against the impropriety of it, and said that she could
never think it a suitable office for him. It was, however,
in vain; he pleaded the royal promise, and
relied on it. The Queen then said she would take a
few days to consider the matter; when, examining
into his character, and finding that he was a sober,
moral man, as well as an intrepid commander, she
sent for him, and gave him the Bishopric, saying
that she "hoped he would take as good care of the
Church, as he had done of the State."</p>


<h3>UNPREACHING PRELATES.</h3>

<p>The appointment of bishops and other ecclesiastics
to lay offices, and more especially to places in the
Mint, during the reign of Edward VI., was severely
censured from the pulpit by the intrepid and venerable
Bishop Latimer. In his "Sermon of the
Plough," he says, with equal humour and vigour:
"But now for the fault of unpreaching prelates,
methinks I could guess what might be said for
excusing them. They are so troubled with lordly
living, they be so placed in palaces, couched in courts,
ruffling in their rents, dancing in their <em>dominions</em>,
burdened with embassages, pampering of their
paunches, like a monk that maketh his jubilee,
munching in their mangers, and moiling in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
gay manors and mansions, and so troubled with
loitering in their lordships, that they cannot attend it.
They are otherwise occupied, some in King's matters,
some are ambassadors, some of the Privy Council,
some to furnish the Court, some are lords of the Parliament,
some are presidents, comptrollers of Mints.
Well, well, is this their duty? Is this their office?
Is this their calling? Should we have ministers of
the Church to be comptrollers of Mints? Is this a
meet office for a priest that hath the cure of souls?
Is this his charge? I would here ask one question:
I would fain know who comptrolleth the devil at
home at his parish, while he comptrolleth the Mint?
If the apostles might not leave the office of preaching
to be deacons, shall one leave it for minting? I cannot
tell you; but the saying is, that since priests have
been minters, money hath been worse than it was
before." In another part of this discourse the Bishop
proceeds to ask, "Is there never a nobleman to be a
Lord President, but it must be a prelate? Is there
never a wise man in the realm to be a comptroller of
the Mint? I speak it to your shame, I speak it to
your shame. If there be never a wise man, make
a water-bearer, a tinker, a cobbler, a slave, a page,
the comptrollers of the Mint. Make a mean gentleman,
a groom, a yeoman; make a poor beggar, Lord
President. Thus I speak, not that I would have it
so, but to your shame, if there be never a gentleman
meet nor able to be Lord President. For why are
not the noblemen and young gentlemen of England
so brought up in knowledge of God and in learning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
that they might be able to execute offices in the
commonweal?"</p>


<h3>CHARLES II. AND HIS CHAPLAIN.</h3>

<p>Dr. Hickringal, who was one of King Charles the
Second's chaplains, whenever he preached before his
Majesty, was sure to tell him of his faults from the
pulpit. One day his Majesty met the Doctor in the
Mall, and said to him, "Doctor, what have I done to
you that you are always quarrelling with me?" "I
hope your Majesty is not angry with me," quoth the
Doctor, "for telling the truth." "No, no," says the
king; "but I would have us for the future be friends."
"Well, well," quoth the Doctor, "I will make it up
with your Majesty on these terms: <em>as you mend I'll
mend</em>."</p>


<h3>RADCLIFFE'S ENMITY TO HANNES.</h3>

<p>John Radcliffe, the eccentric, niggardly, self-indulgent,
ill-educated, and intensely Jacobitish physician,
who, at the end of the seventeenth century, rose to
an eminent place in the capital and at Court, was the
son of a comfortable Yorkshire yeoman. He resided
for some years at Oxford University, and afterwards
practised there; but in 1684 he went up to London,
and speedily made himself a great name and income.
As, however, at Oxford he had found enemies who,
as was the fashion of these days, spoke very openly
and bitterly against their rising rival&mdash;so was it also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
in London: Gibbons, Blackmore, and others, were
hostile to the new-comer&mdash;the first expending his
sarcasm on Radcliffe's defects of scholarship. Radcliffe
replied, by fixing on Gibbons, as is well known
the epithet of "<em>Nurse</em>;" ridiculing his mode of treatment
by slops and gruels, and so forth,&mdash;Radcliffe's
faith being placed in fresh air and exercise, generous
nourishment, and the use of cordials. Sir Edward
Hannes was, like Radcliffe, an Oxford man; and
hence, perhaps, the peculiar jealousy and hatred with
which he regarded Radcliffe. Hannes started in London,
whither he followed Radcliffe, a splendid carriage
and four, that drew upon it the eyes of all the town,
and provoked Radcliffe, when told by a friend that
the horses were the finest he had ever seen, to the
savage reply, "Then he'll be able to sell them for all
the more!" Hannes employed a stratagem that, in
sundry shapes, has since been not quite unfamiliar in
medical practice. He instructed his livery servants to
run about the streets, and, putting their heads into
every coach they met, to inquire in tones of anxiety
and alarm, whether Dr. Hannes was there. Once
one of these servants entered on this advertising
errand Garraway's Coffeehouse, in Exchange Alley&mdash;a
great resort of the medical profession; and called out,
all breathless with haste, "Gentlemen, can any of
your honours tell me if Dr. Hannes is here?" "Who
wants Dr. Hannes, fellow?" asked Radcliffe, who
was in the room. "Lord A&mdash;&mdash;, and Lord B&mdash;&mdash;,"
was the assurance of the servant. "No, no, my man,"
said Radcliffe, in a voice deliberate and full of enjoyment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of the irony; "no, no, you are mistaken; it
isn't the Lords that want your master, but he that
wants them." Hannes was reputed the son of a basket-maker;
Blackmore had been a schoolmaster&mdash;circumstances
which furnished Radcliffe with material for a
savage attack on both, when called in to attend the
young Duke of Gloucester, for whom they had prescribed
until the illness took a fatal turn. He accused
them to their faces, and with no particular gentleness
of language, for having abominably mismanaged a
mere attack of rash; and said, "It would have been
happy for this nation had you, Sir, been bred up a
basket-maker, and you, Sir, remained a country
schoolmaster, rather than have ventured out of your
reach, in the practice of an art to which you are an
utter stranger, and for your blunders in which you
ought to be whipped with one of your own rods."</p>


<h3>MATHEWS OH HIS DEATHBED.</h3>

<p>A friend attending on Charles Mathews the Elder,
the celebrated comedian, in his last illness, intending
to give him his medicine, gave in mistake some
ink from a phial on a shelf. On discovering the error,
his friend exclaimed, "Good heavens! Mathews, I
have given you ink." "Never&mdash;never mind, my boy&mdash;never
mind," said Mathews, faintly, "I'll swallow
a bit of <em>blotting-paper</em>."</p>

<h3>BISHOP BERKELEY'S BERMUDA SCHEME.</h3>

<p>Dr. George Berkeley, the Bishop of Cloyne&mdash;celebrated
for his ideal theory, and by the praise of Pope,
his stedfast friend, who ascribes "to Berkeley every
virtue under heaven," as others ascribed to him all
learning&mdash;in 1824 conceived and published his benevolent
proposal for converting the American savages
to Christianity, by means of a colony to be established
in the Bermudas. The proposal was published in
1723, the year after he had been appointed Dean of
Derry; and he offered to resign that opulent preferment,
worth £1100 a year, and to dedicate the remainder
of his life to the instruction of the Indians,
on the moderate allowance of £100 a-year. The
project was very favourably received, and persons of
the highest rank raised considerable sums by subscription
in aid of it. Berkeley having resigned his preferment,
set sail for Rhode Island, to make arrangements
for carrying out his views. Such was the
influence of his distinguished example, that three of
the junior Fellows of Trinity College, Dublin, abandoned
with him all their flattering prospects in life
in their own country, for a settlement in the Atlantic
Ocean at £40 a-year. The Dean, not meeting with
the support the ministry had promised him, and
after spending nearly all his private property and
seven of the best years of his life in the prosecution
of his scheme, returned to Europe. This, however,
he did not do, until the Bishop of London had informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
him, that on application for funds to Sir
Robert Walpole, he had received the following honest
answer: "If you put this question to me as a
minister, I must and I can assure you, that the money
shall most undoubtedly be paid as soon as suits with
the public convenience; but if you ask me as a friend,
whether Dean Berkeley should continue in America,
expecting the payment of £10,000, advise him, by all
means, to return home to Europe, and give up his
present expectations."</p>


<h3>A HOME-THRUST AT STERNE.</h3>

<p>Sterne, the reverend author of the <cite>Sentimental
Journey</cite>, had the credit of treating his wife very ill.
He was one day talking to Garrick, in a fine sentimental
strain, in laudation of conjugal love and
fidelity. "The husband," said he, "who behaves
unkindly to his wife, deserves to have his house
burnt over his head." "If you think so," replied
Garrick, "I hope <em>your</em> house is insured."</p>


<h3>THE GOSPEL A NOVELTY.</h3>

<p>When Le Torneau preached the Lent sermon at St.
Benoit, at Paris, Louis XIV. inquired of Boileau, "if
he knew anything of a preacher called Le Tourneau,
whom everybody was running after?" "Sire," replied
the poet, "your Majesty knows that people
always run after novelties; this man preaches the
gospel." The King pressing him to speak seriously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Boileau added: "When M. Le Tourneau first ascends
the pulpit, his ugliness so disgusts the congregation
that they wish he would go down again;
but when he begins to speak, they dread the time of
his descending." Boileau's remark as to the "novelty"
of preaching the gospel in his time, brings to mind
the candid confession of a Flemish preacher, who, in
a sermon delivered before an audience wholly of his
own order, said: "We are worse than Judas; he sold
and delivered his Master; we sell Him too, but deliver
Him not." Somewhat akin was the remark, in an
earlier age, of Father Fulgentio, the friend and biographer
of Paul Sarpi, and, like him, a secret friend
to the progress of religious reformation. Preaching
on Pilate's question, "What is truth?" he told the
audience that he had at last, after many searches,
found it out; and, holding forth the New Testament,
said, "Here it is, my friends; but," he added
sorrowfully, as he returned it to his pocket, "it is
<em>a sealed book</em>."</p>


<h3>HARVEY AND THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD.</h3>

<p>The discovery of the circulation of the blood was the
most important ever made in the science of physiology,
and led to a complete revolution throughout the
whole circle of medical knowledge and practice. The
renown of this splendid discovery, by all but universal
consent, has been attributed to William Harvey, an
English physician, who was born at Folkestone in
1578, and in 1593 went to Caius College, Cambridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
where he remained four years. He then
went abroad for several years, studying in the most
famous medical schools; and in 1604, having passed
M.D. at Cambridge, he set up in practice in London.
In 1615 he was appointed Lecturer at the College of
Physicians, on Anatomy and Surgery; and it was in
the performance of these duties that he arrived at
the important discovery that is inseparably associated
with his name. "The merit of Harvey," it has been
justly observed, "is enhanced by considering the
degraded state of medical knowledge at that time in
England. While anatomical schools had been long
established in Italy, France, and Germany, and
several teachers had rendered their names illustrious
by the successful pursuit of the science, anatomy was
still unknown in England, and dissection had hitherto
hardly begun; yet at this inauspicious period did
Harvey make a discovery, which amply justifies
Haller in ranking him as only second to Hippocrates."
In 1620 he promulgated his new doctrine
of the circulation of the blood, in a treatise entitled
<cite>Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in
Animalibus</cite>; in the preface to which, addressed to
the College of Physicians, he states that frequently
in his lectures he had declared his opinion touching
the motion of the heart and the circulation of the
blood, and had for more than nine years confirmed
and illustrated that discovery by reasons and arguments
grounded on ocular demonstration. The attention
of all Europe, and the keen opposition of
many of its medical scholars, were at once aroused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
by Harvey's publication; but his doctrine triumphed
over all objections, and before he died he had the
happiness of seeing it fully established. Harvey was
physician to James I. and Charles I., the latter of
whom had a high regard for him; and at the outbreak
of the civil war he adhered to the royal side,
and quitted London with the king, attending him
at the battle of Edgehill, and afterwards at Oxford.
He died in 1658, it is said from the effects of opium
which he had taken with suicidal intent, while suffering
under the acute pangs of gout. Posterity has
been more faithful and grateful than his own age to
the greatest modern discoverer in medical science;
for his discovery rather tended to push him back
than to advance him in professional position. It has
been said that "perhaps his researches took him out
of the common road to popular eminence, and they
seem to have exposed him to the prejudice so commonly
prevailing against an innovator; for we find
him complaining to a friend, that his practice considerably
declined after the publication of his discovery."</p>


<h3>SUNDAY SPORTS.</h3>

<p>Rushworth relates that King James, in 1618, in
his <cite>Declaration concerning Lawful Sports</cite>, said that
in his progress through Lancashire he did justly
rebuke some Puritans and precise people for the prohibiting
and unlawful punishment of his good people
for using their lawful recreations and honest exercises
upon Sundays and other holidays, after the afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
sermon or service. "With his own ears he heard
the general complaint of his people, that they were
barred from all lawful recreations and exercise upon
the Sundays after noon;" which must produce two
great evils,&mdash;the first, the hindering the conversion
of many whom the clergy caused to believe that
religion, and honest mirth and recreation, were incompatible.
"The other inconvenience is, that this
prohibition barreth the common and meaner sort of
people from using such exercises as may make their
bodies more able for war when his Majesty, or his
successors, shall have occasion to use them; and in
place thereof, sets up tippling and filthy drunkenness,
and breeds a number of idle and discontented
speeches in alehouses. For when shall the common
people have leave to exercise, if not upon the Sundays
and holidays, seeing they must apply their
labour, and win their living, on all working days?
Therefore, the King said, his express pleasure was
that no lawful recreation should be barred to his
good people which did not tend to the breach of the
laws of this kingdom and the canons of the Church:
that after the end of divine service his people be not
disturbed, letted, or discouraged from any lawful
recreation, such as dancing, either men or women;
archery for men, leaping, vaulting, or any other such
harmless recreation; nor from having of May-games,
Whitson-ales, and Morice-dances; and the setting
up of Maypoles, and other sports therewith used, so
as the same be had in due and convenient time,
without impediment or neglect of divine service.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
And that women should have leave to carry rushes
to the church for the decoring of it, according to their
old custom." But bull and bear baiting, "interludes,"
and bowling (at all times prohibited to the
meaner sort), were forbidden; all known recusants
who abstained from coming to service were barred
the liberty of recreation, "being unworthy of any
lawful recreation after the service, that would not
first come to the church and serve God;" as were
also all who, though conforming in religion, had not
been present in church. Each person was to go to
church, and join the sports, in his own parish; and
no weapons of offence were to be carried or used.</p>

<p>Charles I., in 1633, gave command for the reading
of the <cite>Book of Sports</cite> in the churches, which had not
been done even by his father, and which gave great
offence and stirred up much display of bad feeling.
In London, after the reading, one clergyman went on
immediately to read the Ten Commandments, and
said, "Dearly beloved brethren, you have now heard
the commandments of God and man; obey which
you please." Another minister followed up the reading
of the obnoxious ordinance by the delivery of a
sermon on the Fourth Commandment.</p>


<h3>THE SAINT'S BELL.</h3>

<p>In their description of Westmoreland, Nicholson and
Burn relate, that "in the old church at Ravenstonedale
there was a small bell, called the Saint's Bell,
which was wont to be rung after the Nicene creed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to call in the Dissenters to sermon. And to this day
the Dissenters, besides frequenting the meeting-house,
oftentimes attend the sermon in church."</p>


<h3>SIR RICHARD JEBB.</h3>

<p>Sir Richard Jebb, the famous physician, who was
very rough and harsh in his manner, once observed
to a patient to whom he had been extremely rude,
"Sir, it is my way." "Then," returned his indignant
patient, pointing to the door, "I beg you will
make <em>that</em> your way!" Sir Richard being called to
see a patient who fancied himself very ill, told him
ingenuously what he thought, and declined prescribing
for him. "Now you are here," said the patient,
"I shall be obliged to you, Sir Richard, if you will
tell me how I must live&mdash;what I may eat, and what
I may not." "My directions as to that point," replied
Sir Richard, "will be few and simple! You
must not eat the poker, shovel, or tongs, for they are
hard of digestion; nor the bellows, because they are
windy; but eat anything else you please!"</p>


<h3>A SANITARY VIEW OF BAPTISM.</h3>

<p>Crosby's <cite>History of the English Baptists</cite> preserves
the opinion of Sir John Floyer, the physician, that
immersion at baptism was of great value in a sanitary
point of view, and that its discontinuance, about
the year 1600, had been attended with ill effects on
the physical condition of the population. Dealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
with the question purely in a professional sense, he
declared his belief that the English would return to
the practice of immersion, when the medical faculty
or the science of physic had plainly proved to them
by experiment the safety and utility of cold bathing.
"They did great injury to their own children and
all posterity, who first introduced the alteration of
this truly ancient ceremony of immersion, and were
the occasion of a degenerate, sickly, tender race ever
since. Instead of prejudicing the health of their
children, immersion would prevent many hereditary
diseases if it were still practised." He tells, in support
of his belief, that he had been assured by a man,
eighty years old, whose father lived while immersion
was still the practice, that parents at the baptism
would ask the priest to dip well in the water that
part of the child in which any disease used to afflict
themselves, to prevent its descending to their posterity.
And it had long been a proverbial saying
among old people, if any one complained of pain in
their limbs, that "surely that limb had not been dipt
in the font." Immersion, however, was far otherwise
regarded in quarters where professional animus of
another kind militated against its revival by the
powerful dissenting body of the Baptists. Baxter
vehemently and exaggeratedly denounced it as a
breach of the Sixth Commandment, which says,
"Thou shalt not kill;" and called on the civil magistrate
to interfere for its prevention, to save the lives
of the lieges. "Covetous physicians," he thought,
should not be much against the Anabaptists; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
"catarrhs and obstructions, which are the two great
fountains of most mortal diseases in man's body,
could scarce have a more notable means to produce
them where they are not, or to increase them where
they are. Apoplexies, lethargies, palsies, and all
comatous diseases, would be promoted by it"&mdash;and
then comes a long string of terrible maladies that
would follow on the dipping. "In a word, it is good
for nothing but to despatch men out of the world
that are troublesome, and to ranken churchyards."
Again: "If murder be a sin, then dipping ordinarily
in cold water over head in England is a sin. And
if those that would make it men's religion to murder
themselves, and urge it on their consciences as their
duty, are not to be suffered in a commonwealth,
any more than highway murderers; then judge how
these Anabaptists, that teach the necessity of such
dippings, are to be suffered." Had Baxter lived in
these cold water days, tubbing would probably have
taught him a little more toleration.</p>


<h3>BISHOP KENNET ON LATE REPENTANCE.</h3>

<p>Doctor, afterwards Bishop, Kennet preached the funeral
sermon of the first Duke of Devonshire in 1707.
The sentiments of the sermon gave much umbrage;
people complained that the preacher "had built a
bridge to heaven for men of wit and parts, but excluded
the duller part of mankind from any chance
of passing it." The complaint was founded on this
passage, in speaking of a late repentance: "This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
rarely happens but in men of distinguished sense and
judgment. Ordinary abilities may be altogether sunk
by a long vicious course of life; the duller flame is
easily extinguished. The meaner sinful wretches are
commonly given up to a reprobate mind, and die as
stupidly as they lived; while the nobler and brighter
parts have an advantage of understanding the worth
of their souls before they resign them. If they are
allowed the benefit of sickness, they commonly awake
out of their dream of sin, and reflect, and look upwards.
They acknowledge an infinite being; they
feel their own immortal part; they recollect and
relish the Holy Scriptures; they call for the elders
of the church; they think what to answer at a judgment-seat.
Not that God is a respecter of persons;
but the difference is in men; and the more intelligent
the nature is, the more susceptible of divine
grace." The successor to the deceased Duke did not
think ill of the sermon; and recommended Kennet
to the Deanery of Peterborough, which he obtained
in 1707.</p>


<h3>A MAL APROPOS QUOTATION.</h3>

<p>In one of the debates in the House of Lords, on the
war with France in 1794, a speaker quoted the following
lines from Bishop Porteous' <cite>Poem on War</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">"One murder makes a villain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Millions a hero! Princes are privileged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To kill, and numbers sanctify the crime.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! why will kings forget that they are men,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And men that they are brethren? Why delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In human sacrifice? Why burst the ties<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of nature, that should knit their souls together<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In one soft bond of amity and love?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They yet still breathe destruction, still go on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inhumanly ingenious to find out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New pains for life; new terrors for the grave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Artifices of Death! Still monarchs dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of universal empire growing up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From universal ruin. Blast the design,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great God of Hosts! nor let Thy creatures fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unpitied victims at Ambition's shrine."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Bishop, who was present, and who generally
voted with the Ministry, was asked by an independent
nobleman, if he were really the author of the
lines that had been quoted. The Bishop replied,
"Yes, my Lord; but&mdash;they were not composed for
the present war."</p>


<h3>CHARLES II. ON SERMON-READING.</h3>

<p>The practice of reading sermons, now so prevalent,
was reproved by Charles II., in the following ordinance
on the subject, issued by the Chancellor of the
University of Cambridge:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Vice-Chancellor and Gentlemen</i>,&mdash;Whereas his
Majesty is informed, that the practice of reading
sermons is generally taken up by the preachers before
the University, and therefore continues even
before himself; his Majesty hath commanded me to
signify to you his pleasure, that the said practice,
which took its beginning from the disorders of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
late times, be wholly laid aside; and that the said
preachers deliver their sermons, both in Latin and
English, by memory without book; as being a way
of preaching which his Majesty judgeth most agreeable
to the use of foreign Churches, to the custom of
the University heretofore, and to the nature of that
holy exercise. And that his Majesty's command in
these premises may be duly regarded and observed,
his further pleasure is, that the names of all such
ecclesiastical persons as shall continue the present
supine and slothful way of preaching, be from time
to time signified to me by the Vice-Chancellor for
the time being, on pain of his Majesty's displeasure.
October 8, 1674.</p>

<h3>SOUTH ON THE COMMONWEALTH PREACHERS.</h3>

<p>Dr. South, in one of his sermons, thus reflected on
the untrained and fanatical preachers of the time of
the Commonwealth&mdash;many of whom but too well
deserved the strictures:&mdash;"It may not be amiss to
take occasion to utter a great truth, as both worthy
to be now considered, and never to be forgot,&mdash;namely,
that if we reflect upon the late times of confusion
which passed upon the ministry, we shall find that
the grand design of the fanatic crew was to persuade
the world that a standing settled ministry was wholly
useless. This, I say, was the main point which they
then drove at. And the great engine to effect this
was by engaging men of several callings (and those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the meaner still the better) to hold forth and harangue
the multitude, sometimes in the streets, sometimes in
churches, sometimes in barns, and sometimes from
pulpits, and sometimes from tubs, and, in a word,
wheresoever and howsoever they could clock the
senseless and unthinking babble about them. And
with this practice well followed, they (and their
friends the Jesuits) concluded, that in some time it
would be no hard matter to persuade the people,
that if men of other professions were able to teach
and preach the word, then to what purpose should
there be a company of men brought up to it and
maintained in it at the charge of a public allowance?
especially when at the same time the truly
godly so greedily gaped and grasped at it for their
self-denying selves. So that preaching, we see, was
their prime engine. But now what was it, which
encouraged those men to set up for a work, which
(if duly managed) was so difficult in itself, and
which they were never bred to? Why, no doubt it
was, that low, cheap, illiterate way, then commonly
used, and cried up for the only gospel soul-searching
way (as the word then went), and which the craftier
set of them saw well enough, that with a little exercise
and much confidence, they might in a short
time come to equal, if not exceed; as it cannot be
denied, but that some few of them (with the help of
a few friends in masquerade) accordingly did. But,
on the contrary, had preaching been made and
reckoned a matter of solid and true learning, of theological
knowledge and long and severe study (as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the nature of it required it to be), assuredly no
preaching cobbler amongst them all would ever have
ventured so far beyond his last, as to undertake it.
And consequently this their most powerful engine
for supplanting the church and clergy had never
been attempted, nor perhaps so much as thought on;
and therefore of most singular benefit, no question,
would it be to the public, if those who have authority
to second their advice, would counsel the ignorant
and the forward to consider what divinity is, and
what they themselves are, and so to put up their
preaching tools, their Medulla's note-books, their
melleficiums, concordances, and all, and betake
themselves to some useful trade, which nature had
most particularly fitted them for."</p>


<h3>PETER THE GREAT AS DENTIST.</h3>

<p>The Czar Peter, impelled by natural curiosity and
love of science, was very fond of witnessing dissections
and operations. He first made these known in
Russia, and gave orders to be informed when anything
of the kind was going on at the hospitals, that
he might, if possible, be present to gratify his love
for such spectacles. He frequently aided the operator,
and was able to dissect properly, to bleed, draw
teeth, and perform other operations as well as one
of the faculty. Along with a case of mathematical
instruments, he always carried about with him a
pouch furnished with surgical instruments. The wife
of one of his valets had once a disagreeable experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of his skill. She was suspected of gallantry,
and her husband vowed revenge. He sat in the ante-chamber
with a sad and pensive face, provoking the
Czar to inquire the occasion of his gloom. The valet
said that nothing was wrong, except that his wife refused
to have a tooth drawn that caused her great
pain. The Czar desired that he should be allowed
to cure her, and was at once taken to her apartment,
where he made her sit down that he might examine
her mouth, in spite of her earnest protestations that
she had no toothache. The husband, however, alleging
that she always said so when the physician was
present, and renewed her lamentations when he departed,
the Czar ordered him to hold her head and
arms; and, pulling forth his instruments, promptly
extracted the tooth which he supposed to be the
cause of the pain, disregarding the piteous cries of
the persecuted lady. But in a few days the Czar
learned that the whole affair was a trick of the valet
to torment his wife; and his Majesty thereupon, as
his manner was, administered to him a very severe
chastisement with his own hands.</p>


<h3>A MILD CRITICISM.</h3>

<p>While Sir Busick Harwood was Professor of Anatomy
at Cambridge, he was called in, in a case of
some difficulty, by the friends of a patient, who were
anxious for his opinion of the malady. Being told
the name of the medical man who had previously
prescribed, Sir Busick exclaimed, "He! if he were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to descend into the patient's stomach with a candle
and lantern, when he ascended he would not be able
to name the complaint!"</p>


<h3>HOUR-GLASSES IN CHURCH.</h3>

<p>To restrain over-eloquent or over-zealous preachers
in the length of their discourses, hour-glasses were
introduced in churches about the period of the Reformation.
In the frontispiece prefixed to the Bible of
the Bishops' Translation, printed in 1569, Archbishop
Parker is represented with an hour-glass standing on
his right hand. Clocks and watches being then but
rarely in use, the hour-glass was had recourse to as
the only convenient public remembrancer which the
state of the arts could then supply. The practice of
using them became generally prevalent, and continued
till the period of the Revolution. The hour-glass
was placed either on the side of the pulpit, or
on a stand in front. "One whole houre-glasse," "one
halfe houre-glasse," occur in an inventory taken about
1632 of the properties of the church of All Saints at
Newcastle-on-Tyne. Daniel Burgess, a Nonconformist
preacher at the commencement of last century,
alike famous for the length of his pulpit harangues
and the quaintness of his illustrations, was once vehemently
declaiming against the sin of drunkenness.
Having exhausted the customary time, he turned the
hour-glass, and said, "Brethren, I have somewhat
more to say on the nature and consequences of
drunkenness; so let's have <em>the other glass and then</em>&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
The jest, however, seems to have been borrowed from
the frontispiece of a small book, entitled <cite>England's
Shame, or a Relation of the Life and Death of Hugh
Peters</cite>, published in 1663; where Peters is represented
preaching, and holding an hour-glass in his left
hand, in the act of saying, "I know you are good
fellows; so let's have another glass."</p>


<h3>THE METHODIST DOG.</h3>

<p>In the early days of Methodism, meetings for preaching
and prayer were held regularly about Bristol,
and usually well attended. The people who had
frequented these meetings had repeatedly observed a
dog that came from a distance; and as at the house
to which he belonged the Methodists were not respected,
he always came alone. At that time, the
preaching on Sunday began immediately after the
church service ended; and this singular animal, invariably
attending on those occasions, received the
name of the "Methodist Dog." He was generally
met by the congregation returning from the church,
and abused and pelted by the boys belonging to that
party. His regular attendance had often been the
subject of public debate; and, merely to prove the
sagacity of the animal, the meeting, for one evening,
was removed to another house. Surprising as it
may seem, at the proper and exact time he made his
appearance. A few weeks after, his owner returning
intoxicated from Leeds market, was drowned in a
narrow shallow stream; and from that day the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
"Methodist Dog" ceased to attend the preaching.
Concerning this odd fact, a good Methodist (John
Nelson) used to say, "The frequent attendance of
this dog at the meeting was designed to attract his
master's curiosity, and engage him thereby to visit
the place; where, hearing the gospel, he might have
been enlightened, converted, and eternally saved.
But the end to be answered being frustrated by the
master's death, the means to secure it were no longer
needful on the dog's part."</p>


<h3>THE TWO GATES OF HEAVEN.</h3>

<p>"God," says St. Pierre, in his <cite>Harmonies of Nature</cite>,
"God has placed upon earth two gates that lead to
heaven; He has set them at the two extremities of
life&mdash;one at the entrance, the other at the issue. The
first is that of innocence; the second, that of repentance."</p>


<h3>GIBBON'S RETORT ON THE PHYSICIAN.</h3>

<p>A good story of Gibbon the historian is told in
Moore's Memoirs. Gibbon and an eminent French
physician were rivals in courting the favour of Lady
Elizabeth Foster. Impatient at Gibbon's occupying
so much of her attention by his conversation, the
doctor said crossly to him, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quand milady Elizabeth
Foster sera malade de vos fadaises, je la guérirai</i>."
[When my Lady Elizabeth Foster is made ill by your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
twaddle, I will cure her.] On which Gibbon, drawing
himself up grandly, and looking disdainfully at
the physician, replied, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quand milady Elizabeth
Foster sera morte de vos recettes, je l'immortaliserai</i>."
[When my Lady Elizabeth Foster is dead from your
prescriptions, I will immortalize her.]</p>


<h3>TRUMP CARDS.</h3>

<p>Mrs. Bray relates the following instance of the power
of a ruling passion or habit, concerning a Devonshire
physician, boasting the not untradesmanlike name of
Vial, who was a desperate lover of whist. One evening,
in the midst of a deal, the doctor fell off his chair
in a fit. Consternation seized on the company, who
knew not whether he was alive or dead. At length
he showed signs of returning life; and, retaining the
last fond idea that had possessed him at the moment
he fell into the fit, he exclaimed, "<em>What is trumps?</em>"
A <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon-vivant</i>, brought to his deathbed by an immoderate
use of wine, after having been told that he could
not in all human probability survive many hours, and
would die before eight o'clock next morning, summoned
the small remnants of his strength to call the
doctor back, and said, with the true recklessness of a
gambler, "Doctor, I'll bet you a bottle that I live
till nine!"</p>


<h3>PERSUASIVENESS OF WHITFIELD.</h3>

<p>Benjamin Franklin, in his memoirs, bears witness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
to the extraordinary effect that was produced by
Whitfield's preaching in America, and tells an anecdote
equally characteristic of the preacher and of himself.
"I happened," says Franklin, "to attend one
of his sermons, in the course of which I perceived that
he intended to finish with a collection, and I silently
resolved he should get nothing from me. I had in
my pocket a handful of copper money, three or four
silver dollars, and five pistoles in gold. As he proceeded,
I began to soften, and concluded to give
the copper. Another stroke of his oratory made
me ashamed of that, and determined me to give the
silver; and he finished so admirably, that I emptied
my pocket wholly into the collector's dish, gold and
all. At this sermon there was also one of our
club, who, being of my sentiments regarding the
building in Georgia (the subject of Whitfield's appeal),
and suspecting a collection might be intended, had by
precaution emptied his pockets before he came from
home. Towards the conclusion of the discourse, however,
he felt a strong inclination to give, and applied
to a neighbour who stood near him to lend him some
money for the purpose. The request was fortunately
made to perhaps the only man in the company who
had the firmness not to be affected by the preacher.
His answer was: 'At any other time, friend Hodgkinson,
I would lend to thee freely; but not now,
for thee seems to be out of thy right senses.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>


<h3>"PREACHING FOR A CROWN."</h3>

<p>Howell Davies, who was Whitfield's Welsh coadjutor,
walking one Sunday morning to preach, was accosted
by a clergyman on horseback, who was bound on
the same errand, and who complained of the unprofitable
drudgery of his profession, saying that he
could never get more than half-a-guinea for preaching.
The Welshman replied that he for his part was content
to preach <em>for a crown</em>. This so offended the
mounted priest, that he upbraided the pedestrian for
disgracing his cloth. "Perhaps," said Davies, "you
will hold me still cheaper when I inform you that I
am going nine miles to preach, and have only seven-pence
in my pocket to bear my expenses out and in.
But the crown for which I preach is a crown of glory."</p>


<h3>SHEDDING HIS BLOOD FOR HIS COUNTRY.</h3>

<p>Lord Radnor, who lived in the middle of last century,
had a singular liking for the amateur employment
of the lancet on the veins of his friends, or of
persons whom he induced by gifts of money to allow
him to display his skill upon them. It is told of
Lord Chesterfield, that, desiring the vote of Lord
Radnor in some division impending in the House of
Lords, he went to him, and by and by, in the course
of indifferent conversation, complained that he was
suffering from a bad headache. Lord Radnor leaped
at the opportunity of indulging his predilection for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
phlebotomy on such a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corpus nobile</i>; he told Lord
Chesterfield that he ought to lose blood at once.
"Do you indeed think so, my dear Lord? Then do
me the favour to add to the service of your advice
that of your skill. I know that you are a clever
surgeon." In a moment Lord Radnor had pulled
out his lancet case, and opened a vein in his visitor's
arm; who subsequently, when the bandage was being
put on, as if casually, asked the operator, "By the
by, does your Lordship go down to the House to-day?"
Lord Radnor answered that he had not intended
going, not having information enough as to
the question that was to be debated; "But on what
side will you, that have considered the matter, vote?"
Lord Chesterfield stated his views to his amateur
surgeon, whose vanity he had so cleverly flattered;
and left the house with the promise of Lord Radnor's
vote&mdash;having literally, as he told an intensely amused
party of his friends the same evening, "shed his
blood for the good of his country."</p>


<h3>DR. KIRWAN, DEAN OF KILLALA.</h3>

<p>Towards the end of last century, there arose in Ireland
an eminent preacher, who, to use the emphatic
language of Grattan, "broke through the slumbers
of the pulpit." This was Walter Blake Kirwan,
originally a Catholic priest and Professor of Philosophy
at Louvain, and afterwards chaplain to the
Neapolitan embassy at London. In 1787 he resolved
to conform to the Establishment, and preached for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
first time to a Protestant congregation in St. Peter's
Church at Dublin. He subsequently became Prebend
of Howth, Rector of St. Nicholas, Dublin, and ultimately
Dean of Killala. Wonders have been recorded
of his attractiveness as a preacher. That he was a
great orator, the manner in which he was attended
abundantly proved. People crowded to hear him,
who on no other occasion appeared within the walls
of a church: men of the world, who had other pursuits,
men of professions, physicians, lawyers, actors&mdash;in
short, all to whom clergymen of the highest order
had any charms. The pressure of the crowds was
immense; guards were obliged to be stationed, and
even palisades erected, to keep off from the largest
churches the overflowing curiosity, which could not
contribute adequately to the great charities for which
he generally preached. The sums collected on these
occasions exceeded anything ever before known. In
one instance, such was the magical impression he
produced, that many persons, ladies particularly,
after contributing all the money they had about
them, threw their watches, rings, and other valuable
ornaments into the plate, and next day redeemed
them with money. The produce of this triumph of
pulpit oratory was indeed magnificent; it was no
less than £1200&mdash;a much larger sum at that day
than the figures represent in ours. Worn out by
his labours, Dr. Kirwan died in 1805; and a book of
sermons printed in 1814 is his sole literary memorial.</p>

<h3>JEREMY TAYLOR.</h3>

<p>Jeremy Taylor, Bishop of Down, from the fertility
of his mind and the extent of his imagination, has
been styled "the Shakespeare of English divines."
His sermons abound with some of the most brilliant
passages; and embrace such a variety of matter, and
such a mass of knowledge and of learning, that even
the acute Bishop Warburton said of him: "I can
fathom the understandings of most men, yet I am
not certain that I can fathom the understanding of
Jeremy Taylor." His comparison between a married
and a single life, in his sermon on the Blessedness of
Marriage, is rich in tender sentiments and exquisitely
elegant imagery. "Marriage," says the Bishop, "is
the mother of the world, and preserves kingdoms,
and fills cities, churches, and even heaven itself.
Celibacy, like the fly in the heart of an apple, dwells
in a perpetual sweetness; yet sits alone, and is confined,
and dies in singularity. But marriage, like the
useful bee, builds a house, and gathers sweetness
from every flower, and labours and unites into societies
and republics, and sends out colonies, and fills the
world with delicacies, and obeys the king, keeps
order, and exercises many virtues, and promotes the
interest of mankind; and is that state of things to
which God hath designed the present constitution
of the world. Marriage hath in it the labour of love,
and the delicacies of friendship; the blessings of
society, and the union of hands and hearts. It hath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
in it less of beauty, but more of safety, than a single
life; it is more merry and more sad; is fuller of joy
and fuller of sorrow; it lies under more burthens, but
is supported by the strength of love and charity; and
these burthens are delightful."</p>


<h3>A TWO-EDGED ACCUSATION.</h3>

<p>Dr. Freind, like too many of the physicians of his
time&mdash;under Queen Anne&mdash;was not very careful to
keep his head clear and hand steady by moderation
in tavern potations; and more often than not he was
tipsy when he visited his patients. Once he entered
the chamber of a lady of high rank in such a state of
intoxicated confusion, that he could do nothing more
than mutter to himself, "Drunk&mdash;drunk&mdash;drunk, by
&mdash;&mdash;!" Happily, or unhappily, the lady, from the
same cause, was not in any better case than the physician;
and when she came to herself, she was informed
by her maid that the doctor had briefly and
gruffly described <em>her</em> condition, and then abruptly
taken his leave. Freind next day was puzzling as to
the apology he should offer to his patient for his unfitness
to deal with her ailment, when to his great
joy there came a note from the lady, enclosing a
handsome fee, and entreating him to keep his own
counsel as to what he had seen.</p>


<h3>RADCLIFFE AND KNELLER.</h3>

<p>Sir Godfrey Kneller and Dr. Radcliffe lived next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
door to each other in Bow Street, just after the
latter had come up to town, and were extremely intimate.
Kneller had a very fine garden, and as the
doctor was fond of flowers, he permitted him to have
a door into it. Radcliffe's servants, however, gathering
and destroying the flowers, Kneller sent to inform
him that he would nail up the door; to which Radcliffe,
in his rough manner, replied, "Tell him he
may do anything but paint it."&mdash;"Well," retorted
Kneller, "he may say what he will; for tell him, I
will take anything from him, except physic."</p>


<h3>SLAPS FOR SLEEPERS IN CHURCH.</h3>

<p>A Methodist preacher once, observing that several
of his congregation had fallen asleep, exclaimed with
a loud voice, "A fire! a fire!" "Where? where?"
cried his auditors, whom the alarm had thoroughly
aroused from their slumbers. "In the place of
judgment," said the preacher, "for those who sleep
under the ministry of the holy gospel." Another
preacher, of a different persuasion, more remarkable
for drowsy hearers, finding himself in a like unpleasant
situation with his auditory, or rather <em>dormitory</em>,
suddenly stopped in his discourse, and, addressing himself
in a whispering tone to a number of noisy children
in the gallery, said, "Silence! silence! children;
if you keep up such a noise, you will waken all the
old folks below." Dr. South, chaplain of Charles II.,
once when preaching before the Court&mdash;then composed,
as every one knows, of the most profligate and dissolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
men in the nation&mdash;saw, in the middle of his
discourse, that sleep had gradually made a conquest
of his hearers. He immediately stopped short, and,
changing his tone, called out to Lord Lauderdale
three times. His Lordship standing up, Dr. South
said, with great composure, "My Lord, I am sorry
to interrupt your repose; but I must beg of you that
you will not snore quite so loud, lest you awaken
his Majesty."</p>

<p>Lassenius, chaplain to the Danish Court in the end
of the seventeenth century, for a long time, to his
vexation, had seen that during his sermon the greater
part of the congregation fell asleep. One day he suddenly
stopped, and, pulling shuttlecock and battledore
from his pocket, began to play with them in the
pulpit. This odd behaviour naturally attracted the
attention of the hearers who were still awake; they
jogged the sleepers, and in a very short time everybody
was lively, and looking to the pulpit with the
greatest astonishment. Then Lassenius began a very
severe castigatory discourse, saying, "When I announce
to you sacred and important truths, you are
not ashamed to go to sleep; but when I play the
fool, you are all eye and ear."</p>

<p>When Fenelon, as almoner, attended Louis XIV. to
a sermon preached by a Capuchin, he fell asleep.
The Capuchin perceived it, and breaking off his discourse,
cried out, "Awake that sleeping Abbé, who
comes here only to pay his court to the King;" a
reproof which Fenelon himself often related with
pleasure after he became Archbishop of Cambray.</p>

<h3>A PRESCRIPTION FOR LONG LIFE.</h3>

<p>In the reign of Francis I. of France, the saying went&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0"><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Souper à cinq, coucher à neuf,</i><br /></span>

</div></div>


<h3>ABERNETHY AND THE DUKE OF YORK.</h3>

<p>The Duke of York once consulted Abernethy. During
the time his Highness was in the room, the doctor
stood before him with his hands in his pockets,
waiting to be addressed, and whistling with great
coolness. The Duke, naturally astonished at his conduct,
said, "I suppose you know who I am?"&mdash;"Suppose
I do; what of that? If your Highness of
York wishes to be well, let me tell you," added the
surgeon, "you must do as the Duke of Wellington
often did in his campaigns,&mdash;<em>cut off the supplies</em>, and
the enemy will quickly leave the citadel."</p>


<h3>AN UNLUCKY COINCIDENCE.</h3>

<p>Dean Ramsay "remembers in the parish church of
Fettercairn, though it must be sixty years ago, a
custom, still lingering in some parts of the country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
of the precentor reading out each single line before
it was sung by the congregation. This practice gave
rise to a somewhat unlucky introduction of a line
from the first Psalm. In most churches in Scotland
the communion tables are placed in the centre of the
church. After sermon and prayer, the seats round
these tables are occupied by the communicants while
a psalm is being sung. One communion Sunday, the
precentor observed the noble family of Eglantine
approaching the tables, and likely to be kept out by
those who pressed in before them. Being very zealous
for their accommodation, he called out to an individual
whom he considered to be the principal obstacle
in clearing the passage, 'Come back, Jock, and
let in the noble family of Eglantine;' and then, turning
to his psalm-book, he took up his duty, and went
on to read the line, '<em>Nor stand in sinners' way</em>.'"</p>


<h3>LICENSED LAY PREACHING.</h3>

<p>In 1555, Mr. Tavernier, of Bresley, in Norfolk, had a
special licence signed by Edward VI., authorizing
him to preach in any part of his Majesty's dominions,
though he was a layman; and he is said to have
preached before the King at court, wearing a velvet
bonnet or round cap, a damask gown, and a gold chain
about his neck. In the reign of Mary he appeared
in the pulpit of St. Mary's at Oxford, with a sword
by his side and a gold chain about his neck, and
preached to the scholars, opening his discourse in
this wise: "Arriving at the mount of St. Mary's, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the stony stage where I now stand, I have brought
you some fine biscuits, baked in the oven of charity,
carefully conserved for the chickens of the church."
This sort of style, especially the alliteration, was
much admired in those days, even by the most accomplished
scholars; and was long afterwards in
high favour both with speakers and hearers. At the
time Mr. Tavernier first received commission as a
preacher, good preaching was so very scarce, that
not only the King's chaplains were obliged to make
circuits round the country to instruct the people,
and to fortify them against Popery, but even laymen,
who were scholars, were, as we have seen, employed
for that purpose.</p>


<h3>DR. BARROW'S RHYMES WITH REASON.</h3>

<p>In the days of Charles II., candidates for holy orders
were expected to respond in Latin to the various interrogatories
put to them by the bishop or his examining
chaplain. When the celebrated Barrow
(who was fellow of Trinity College, and tutor to the
immortal Newton) had taken his bachelor's degree,
he presented himself before the bishop's chaplain,
who, with the stiff stern visage of the times, said to
Barrow&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quid est fides?</i>" (What is faith?)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod non vides</i>" (What thou dost not see),<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>answered Barrow with the utmost promptitude. The
chaplain, a little annoyed at Barrow's laconic answer,
continued&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quid est spes?</i>" (What is hope?)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magna res</i>" (A great thing),<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>replied the young candidate in the same breath.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quid est caritas?</i>" (What is charity?)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>was the next question.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magna raritas</i>" (A great rarity),<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>was again the prompt reply of Barrow, blending truth
and rhyme with a precision that staggered the reverend
examiner, who went direct to the bishop and
told him that a young Cantab had thought proper to
give rhyming answers to three several moral questions,
and added that he believed his name was Isaac
Barrow, of Trinity College, Cambridge. "Barrow!
Barrow!" said the bishop, who well knew the literary
and moral worth of the young bachelor; "if
that's the case, ask him no more questions, for he is
much better qualified to examine us than we are to
examine him." Barrow received his letters of orders
forthwith.</p>


<h3>HOW TO BE KEPT IN HEALTH.</h3>

<p>Sir G. Staunton related a curious anecdote of old
Kien Long, Emperor of China. He was inquiring
of Sir George the manner in which physicians were
paid in England. When, after some difficulty, his
Majesty was made to comprehend the system, he
exclaimed, "Is any man well in England, that can
afford to be ill? Now, I will inform you," said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
"how I manage my physicians. I have four, to
whom the care of my health is committed: a certain
weekly salary is allowed them, but the moment I am
ill, the salary stops till I am well again. I need not
inform you that my illnesses are usually short."</p>


<h3>JOHN HUNTER ROUTING THE ROUT.</h3>

<p>Mr. Jeaffreson, in his amusing <cite>Book about Doctors</cite>,
tells a good story about the great anatomist, John
Hunter. "His wife, though devoted in her attachment
to him, and in every respect a lady worthy of
esteem, caused her husband at times no little vexation
by her fondness for society. She was in the
habit of giving enormous routs, at which authors
and artists, of all shades of merit and demerit, used
to assemble to render homage to her literary powers,
which were very far from commonplace. Hunter
had no sympathy with his wife's poetical aspirations,
still less with the society which those aspirations led
her to cultivate. Grudging the time which the labours
of practice prevented him from devoting to the
pursuits of his museum and laboratory, he could not
restrain his too irritable temper when Mrs. Hunter's
frivolous amusements deprived him of the quiet
requisite for study.... Imagine the wrath of such
a man, finding, on his return from a long day's work,
his house full of musical professors, connoisseurs, and
fashionable idlers&mdash;in fact, all the confusion and
hubbub and heat of a grand party, which his lady
had forgotten to inform him was that evening to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
come off! Walking straight into the middle of the
principal reception-room, he faced round and surveyed
his unwelcome guests, who were not a little
surprised to see him&mdash;dusty, toil-worn, and grim&mdash;so
unlike what 'the man of the house' ought to be
on such an occasion. 'I knew nothing,' was his
brief address to the astounded crowd&mdash;'I knew
nothing of this kick-up, and I ought to have been
informed of it beforehand; but, as I have now
returned home to study, I hope the present company
will retire.' Mrs. Hunter's drawing-rooms were
speedily empty."</p>


<h3>ANTICS OF THE FANATICS.</h3>

<p>In concord, yet in contrast, with Dr. South's censure
on the fanatics of the Commonwealth, noticed on a
former page, we take this from the <cite>Loyal Satirist, or
Hudibras in Prose</cite>, published among <cite>Somers' Tracts</cite>:&mdash;"Well,
who's for Aldermanbury? You would think
a ph&oelig;nix preached there; but the birds will flock
after an owl as fast; and a foot-ball in cold weather
is as much followed as Calama (Calamy) by all his
rampant dog-day zealots. But 'tis worth the crouding
to hear the baboon expound like the ape taught
to play on the cittern. You would think the church,
as well as religion, were inversed, and the anticks
which were used to be without were removed into
the pulpit. Yet these apish tricks must be the
motions of the spirit, his whimsie-meagrim must be
an ecstatie, and Dr. G&mdash;&mdash;, his palsy make him the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
father of the sanctified shakers. Thus, among Turks,
dizziness is a divine trance, changlings and idiots
are the chiefest saints, and 'tis the greatest sign of
revelation to be out of one's wits.</p>

<p>"Instead of a dumb-shew, enter the sermon dawbers.
O what a gracious sight is a silver inkhorn!
How blessed a gift is it to write shorthand! What
necessary implements for a saint are cotton wool and
blotting-paper! These dablers turn the church into
a scrivener's shop. A country fellow last term mistook
it for the Six Clerks' Office. The parson looks
like an offender upon the scaffold, and they penning
his confession; or a spirit conjured up by their uncouth
characters. By his cloak you would take him
for the prologue to a play; but his sermon, by the
length of it, should be a taylor's bill; and what
treats it of but such buckram, fustian stuff? What
a desperate green-sickness is the land fallen into,
thus to doat on coals and dirt, and such rubbish
divinity! Must the French cook our sermons too!
and are frogs, fungos, and toadstools the chiefest
dish in a spiritual collation? Strange Israelites!
that cannot distinguish betwixt mildew and manna.
Certainly in the brightest sunshine of the gospel
clouds are the best guides; and woodcocks are the
only birds of paradise. I wonder how the ignorant
rabbies should differ so much, since most of their
libraries consist only of a concordance. The wise
men's star doubtless was an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ignis fatuus</i> in a churchyard;
and it was some such Will-o'-th'-Whisp steered
prophetical Saltmarsh, when, riding post to heaven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
he lost his way in so much of revelation as not to be
understood; like the musick of the spheres, which
never was heard."</p>


<h3>POPE'S LAST EPIGRAM.</h3>

<p>During Pope's last illness, it is said, a squabble
happened in his chamber between his two physicians,
Dr. Burton and Dr. Thomson, who mutually
charged each other with hastening the death of the
patient by improper treatment. Pope at length
silenced them by saying, "Gentlemen, I only learn
by your discourse that I am in a dangerous way;
therefore, all I now ask is, that the following epigram
may be added after my death to the next
edition of the Dunciad, by way of postscript:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Dunces rejoice, forgive all censures past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The greatest dunce has kill'd your foe at last.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h3>TRANSFUSION OF BLOOD.</h3>

<p>The experiment of transferring the blood of one
animal into the vascular system of another, by means
of a tube connected with a vein of the receiving
animal and an artery of the other&mdash;which had been
unsuccessfully attempted in 1492 in the hope of
saving the life of Pope Innocent VIII.&mdash;was first
tried in England in the year 1657 by Clarke, who
failed in his attempts. Lower, of Oxford, succeeded
in 1665, and communicated his success to the Royal
Society. This was on dogs. Coxe did it on pigeons;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and Coxe and King afterwards exhibited the experiment
on dogs before the Society, transfusing the
blood from vein to vein. It was again performed
from a sheep to a dog, and the experiment was frequently
repeated. The first attempts at transfusion
appear to have been instigated merely by curiosity,
or by a disposition to inquire into the powers of
animal economy. But higher views soon opened
themselves; it was conceived that inveterate diseases,
such as epilepsy, gout, and others, supposed
to reside in the blood, might be expelled with that
fluid; while with the blood of a sheep or calf the
health and strength of the animal might be transferred
to the patient. The most sanguine anticipations
were indulged, and the new process was almost
expected to realize the alchemical reveries of an
elixir of life and immortality. The experiment was
first tried in France, where the blood of a sheep, the
most stupid of all animals, according to Buffon, was
transfused into the veins of an idiotic youth, with
the effect, as was asserted, of sharpening his wits;
and a similar experiment was made without injury
on a healthy man. Lower and King transferred
blood from a sheep into the system of a literary
man, who had offered himself for the experiment,
at first without inconvenience, but afterwards with
a less favourable result; the Royal Society still recommending
perseverance in the trials. These events
were not calculated to maintain the expectation of
brilliant results that had been raised; and other
occurrences produced still more severe disappointment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
The French youth first mentioned died lethargic
soon after the second transfusion; the physicians
incurred great disgrace, and were judicially prosecuted
by the relations. Not, however, discouraged
by this unlucky event, they soon after transfused
the blood of a calf into a youth related to the royal
family, who died soon after of a local inflammation.
The Parliament of Paris now interfered, and proscribed
the practice; and two persons having died
after transfusion at Rome, the Pope also issued a
prohibitory edict. Since the publication in 1824,
however, of Dr. Blundell's <cite>Physiological and Pathological
Researches</cite>, transfusion has been recognised as
a legitimate operation in obstetric surgery&mdash;the object
being to obviate the effects of exhaustion from
extreme loss of blood by hæmorrhage.</p>


<h3>FATHER ANDRE BOULANGER.</h3>

<p>France has produced several entertaining preachers,
among whom was André Boulanger, better known
as "little Father André," who died about the middle
of the seventeenth century. His character has been
variously drawn. He is by some represented as a
buffoon in the pulpit; but others more judiciously
observe, that he only indulged his natural genius,
and uttered humorous and lively things to keep the
attention of his audience awake. "He told many a
bold truth," says the author of <cite>Guerre des Auteurs,
Anciens et Modernes</cite>, "that sent bishops to their
dioceses, and made many a coquette blush. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
possessed the art of biting while he smiled; and
more ably combated vice by his ingenious satire,
than by those vague apostrophes which no one takes
to himself. While others were straining their minds
to catch at sublime thoughts which no one understood,
he lowered his talents to the most humble
situations, and to the minutest things." In fact,
Father André seems to have been a sort of seventeenth
century Spurgeon, as two samples may serve
to show. In one of his sermons he compared the
four doctors of the Latin Church to the four kings
of cards. "St. Augustine," said he, "is the King
of Hearts, for his great charity; St. Ambrose is the
King of Clubs (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">treflé</i>), by the flowers of his eloquence;
St. Gregory is the King of Diamonds, for
his strict regularity; and St. Jerome is the King of
Spades (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pique</i>), for his piquant style." The Duke of
Orleans once dared Father André to employ any
ridiculous expression about him. This, however, the
good father did, very adroitly. He addressed the
Duke thus: "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Foin de vous, Monseigneur; foin de
moi; foin de tous les auditeurs</i>." He saved himself
from the consequences of his jest, by taking for his
text the seventh verse of the tenth chapter of Isaiah,
where it is said, "All the people are grass"&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Foin</i>
in French signifying hay, and being also an interjection,
"Fie upon!"</p>


<h3>AN INTERCESSOR FOR HIMSELF.</h3>

<p>A Protestant renting a little farm under the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Duke of Gordon, a Catholic, fell behind in his payments;
and the steward, in his master's absence,
seized the farmer's stock and advertised it to be
rouped on a certain day. In the interval, the Duke
returned home, and the tenant went to him to entreat
indulgence. "What is the matter, Donald?"
said the Duke, seeing him enter with sad and downcast
looks. Donald told his sorrowful tale concisely
and naturally: it touched the Duke's heart, and produced
a formal quittance of the debt. Donald, as he
cheerily withdrew, was seen staring at the pictures
and images he saw in the Duke's hall, and expressed
to his Grace, in a homely way, a wish to know who
they were. "These," said the Duke, "are the saints
who intercede with God for me." "My Lord Duke,"
said the tenant, "would it not be better to apply
yourself directly to God? I went to mickle Sandy
Gordon, and to little Sandy Gordon; but if I had
not come to your good Grace's self, I could not have
got my discharge, and baith I and my bairns had
been harried out of house and hame."</p>


<h3>WHITFIELD'S INFLUENCE ON THE CHURCH.</h3>

<p>Toplady speaks thus, in a sermon, of the Establishment
to which he belonged, and the effect on its
ministers of the work of Whitfield beyond its pale:&mdash;"I
believe no denomination of professing Christians
(the Church of Rome excepted) were so generally
void of the light and life of godliness, so generally destitute
of the doctrine and of the grace of the gospel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
as was the Church of England, considered as a body,
about fifty years ago. At that period, a <em>converted</em>
minister in the Establishment was as great a wonder
as a comet; but now, blessed be God, since that precious,
that great apostle of the English empire, the
late dear Mr. Whitfield, was raised up in the spirit and
power of Elias, the word of God has run and been
glorified; many have believed and been added to the
Lord all over the three kingdoms; and still, blessed
be His name, the great Shepherd and Bishop of souls
continues to issue His word; and great is the company
of preachers, greater and greater every year."
This was indeed a liberality far in advance of Toplady's
time.</p>


<h3>GENEROSITY OF DR. GREGORY.</h3>

<p>It was the custom of the Professors of Edinburgh
University, in the time of this amiable and learned
man&mdash;as it is partly still&mdash;to receive at their own
residences the fees from students intending to attend
their lectures; some old students yet remembering
that, when other material for the class-tickets failed,
and sometimes even when it did not, the necessary
formula was written on the back of a playing-card.
While Dr. Gregory was one day at the receipt of fees,
he left his room, in which was a single student, and
went into an adjoining apartment for more admission
cards. In this room there was a mirror, in which
the doctor saw the student lift and pocket a portion
of a pile of guineas that lay on the table. Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Gregory took no notice of what he had seen till he was
showing the student out; but on the threshold he
said, with a voice marked with deep emotion, "Young
man, I saw what you did just now. Keep the money;
I know what distress you must be in. But for God's
sake never do it again; it can never succeed." The
remorseful student sought in vain to persuade the
Professor to take back the money: "No, this must
be your punishment, that you must keep it now that
you have taken it." The kind warning was not lost;
the student, we are assured, turned out a good and
honest man. At another time Gregory attended a
poor medical student, ill of typhus fever, who offered
him the customary fee of a guinea. The doctor
refused it in silence, and with signs of annoyance
and anger at the offer; whereupon the student hastily
said, "I beg your pardon, Dr. Gregory; I did not
know your rule. Dr. A. has always taken a fee."
"Oh, he has, has he?" said Gregory; "then, my
young friend, ask him to meet me here in consultation&mdash;and
offer me the fee first." The consultation
took place, and the student offered the fee; whereupon
the good Gregory broke out: "Sir, do you
mean to insult me? Is there a Professor in this University
who would so far degrade himself, as to take
payment from one of his brotherhood, and a junior?"
Dr. A. did not enjoy the little scene that had been
prepared for him; and that very day he returned
the fees he had taken of the sick student.</p>

<h3>RUDE TRUTH FOR A QUEEN.</h3>

<p>It is well known to how great an extent Queen
Elizabeth, with all her strength of mind, was beset
by the weakness of her sex in what concerned her
age and her personal appearance. "The majesty
and gravity of a sceptre," says one of her contemporaries,
"could not alter the nature of a woman in
her. When Bishop Rudd was appointed to preach
before her, he, wishing in a godly zeal, as well became
him, that she should think sometimes of mortality,
being then sixty-three years of age&mdash;he took
his text fit for that purpose out of the Psalms, xc.
12: 'Teach us to <em>number</em> our days, that we may
incline our hearts unto wisdom;' which text he
handled most learnedly. But when he spoke of some
sacred and mystical numbers, as three for the Trinity,
three times three for the heavenly hierarchy, seven
for the Sabbath, and seven times seven for a jubilee;
and lastly, nine times seven for the grand climacterical
year (her age), she, perceiving whereto it tended,
began to be troubled by it. The Bishop, discovering
that all was not well, for the pulpit stood opposite
her Majesty, he fell to treat of some more plausible
(pleasing) numbers, as of the number 666, making
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Latinus</i>, with which, he said, he could prove Pope
to be Antichrist, etc. He still, however, interlarded
his sermon with Scripture passages, touching the
infirmities of age, as that in Ecclesiastes: 'When
the grinders shall be few in number, and they wax<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
dark that look out of the windows,' etc.; 'and the
daughters of singing shall be abased;' and more to
that purpose. The Queen, as the manner was, opened
the window; but she was so far from giving him
thanks or good countenance, that she said plainly:
'He might have kept his arithmetic for himself; but
I see the greatest clerks are not the wisest men;'
and so she went away discontented."</p>


<h3>AN ARCHBISHOP'S INSTALLATION FEAST.</h3>

<p>Fuller, in his <cite>Church History</cite>, relates that "George
Nevill, brother to the great Earl of Warwick, at his
instalment into the Archbishoprick of York, gave a
prodigious feast to all the nobility, most of the prime
clergy, and many of the great gentry, wherein, by
his bill of fare, three hundred quarters of wheat,
three hundred and thirty tuns of ale, one hundred
and four tuns of wine, one pipe of spiced wine, eighty
fat oxen, six wild bulls, one thousand and four
wethers, three hundred hogs, three hundred calves,
three thousand geese, three thousand capons, three
hundred pigs, one hundred peacocks, two hundred
cranes, two hundred kids, two thousand chickens,
four thousand pigeons, four thousand rabbits, two
hundred and four bitterns, four thousand ducks,
two hundred pheasants, five hundred partridges, four
thousand woodcocks, four hundred plovers, one hundred
curlews, one hundred quails, one thousand
egrets, two hundred roes, above four hundred bucks,
does, and roebucks, one thousand five hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
six hot venison pasties, four thousand cold venison
pasties, one thousand dishes of jelly parted, four
thousand dishes of plain jelly, four thousand cold
custards, two thousand hot custards, three hundred
pike, three hundred bream, eight seals, four porpoises,
and four hundred tarts. At this feast the
Earl of Warwick was steward, the Earl of Bedford,
treasurer, the Lord of Hastings, comptroller, with
many more noble officers; servitors, one thousand;
cooks, sixty-two; kitcheners, five hundred and
fifteen.... But," continues honest Fuller, "seven
years after, the King seized on all the estate of this
archbishop, and sent him over prisoner to Calais in
France, where <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vinctus jacuit in summa inopia</i>, he
was kept bound in extreme poverty. Justice thus
punished his former prodigality."</p>


<h3>DA VINCI A GREAT ANATOMIST.</h3>

<p>Leonardo Da Vinci, to his talents as a painter,
added that of being the best anatomist and physiologist
of his time, and was the first person who introduced
the practice of making anatomical drawings.
Vassari, in his <cite>Lives of the Painters</cite>, says that Leonardo
made a book of studies, drawn with red chalk,
and touched with a pen with great diligence, of such
subjects as Marc Antonio de la Torre, an excellent
philosopher of that day, had dissected. "And concerning
those from part to part, he wrote remarks in
letters of an ugly form, which are written by the left
hand backwards, and not to be understood but by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
those who knew the method of reading them; for
they are not to be read without a looking-glass."
Those very drawings and writings alluded to by
Vassari, were happily found to be preserved in the
royal collection of original drawings, where Dr.
Hunter was permitted to examine them. The Doctor,
in noticing them, says: "I expected to see little
more than such designs in anatomy as might be useful
to the painter in his own profession; but I saw,
and, indeed, with astonishment, that Leonardo had
been a general and a deep student. When I consider
what pains he has taken upon every part of the body,
the superiority of his universal genius, his particular
excellence in mechanics and hydraulics, and the attention
with which such a man would examine and
see objects which he was to draw, I am fully persuaded
that Leonardo was the best anatomist at that
time in the world."</p>


<h3>EXTRAVAGANCES OF THE HERRNHUTERS.</h3>

<p>In a letter to Count Zinzendorf&mdash;the founder of the
community of Moravian Brethren at Herrnhut, in
Upper Lusatia&mdash;who visited England about 1745,
Whitfield thus describes and rebukes some of the extravagant
flummeries then practised by the Moravians:
"Pray, my Lord, what instances have we of
the first Christians walking round the graves of their
deceased friends on Easter day, attended with
hautboys, trumpets, French horns, violins, and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
kinds of musical instruments? Or where have we
the least mention made of pictures of particular persons
being brought into the Christian assemblies, and
of candles being placed behind them in order to give
a transparent view of the figures? Where was it
ever known that the picture of the Apostle Paul, representing
him handing a gentleman and lady up to
the side of Jesus Christ, was ever introduced into the
primitive love-feasts?... Again, my Lord, I beg leave
to inquire whether we hear anything in Scripture of
eldresses or deaconesses of the apostolical churches seating
themselves before a table covered with artificial
flowers, and against that a little altar surrounded
with wax tapers, on which stood a cross, composed
either of mock or real diamonds, or other glittering
stones? And yet your Lordship must be sensible
this was done in Fetter Lane Chapel, for Mrs. Hannah
Nitschman, the present general eldress of your congregation;
with this addition, that all the sisters were
seated, clothed in white, and with German caps; the
organ also illuminated with three pyramids of wax
tapers, each of which was tied with a red ribbon; and
over the head of the general eldress was placed her
own picture, and over that (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">horresco referens</i>) the
picture of the Son of God. A goodly sight this, my
Lord, for a company of English Protestants to behold!...
A like scene to this was exhibited by the single
brethren in a room of their house at Hatton Garden.
The floor was covered with sand and moss, and in the
middle of it was paved a star of different-coloured
pebbles; upon that was placed a gilded dove, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
spouted water out of its mouth into a vessel prepared
for its reception, which was curiously decked with
artificial leaves and flags; the room was hung with
moss and shell; the Count, his son, and son-in-law,
in honour of whom all this was done, with Mrs.
Hannah Nitschman, and Mr. Peter Boehlen, and some
other labourers, were also present. These were seated
under an alcove, supported by columns made of pasteboard,
and over their heads was painted an oval in
imitation of marble, containing cyphers of Count
Zinzendorf's family. Upon a side-table was a little
altar covered with shells, and on each side of the
altar was a bloody heart, out of, or near which, proceeded
flames. The room was illuminated with wax
tapers, and musicians played in an adjoining apartment,
while the company performed their devotions,
and regaled themselves with sweetmeats, coffee, tea,
and wine." Mr. Whitfield also mentions a "singular
expedient" made use of to raise the drooping spirits
of one Mr. Bell, who had been induced to join the
Brethren. On his birthday, he was sent for by Mr.
Peter Boehlen, one of the bishops, and "was introduced
into a hall, where was placed an artificial mountain,
which, upon singing a particular verse, was made to
fall down, and then behind it was discovered an illumination,
representing Jesus Christ and Mr. Bell
sitting very near, or embracing each other; and out
of the clouds was also represented plenty of money
falling round Mr. Bell and the Saviour." Towards
the close of his career, Count Zinzendorf applied himself,
and not without success, to undo a good deal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the extravagant and unseemly work of former years,
both in his devotional hymns and forms.</p>


<h3>AN AWKWARD ASSOCIATION.</h3>

<p>In his <cite>Jest-book</cite>, Mr. Lemon tells the following
capital story of awkward association:&mdash;"In a cause
tried in the Court of Queen's Bench, the plaintiff
being a widow, and the defendants two medical men
who had treated her for delirium tremens, and put
her under restraint as a lunatic, witnesses were
called on the part of the plaintiff to prove that she
was not addicted to drinking. The last witness
called by Mr. Montagu Chambers, the leading counsel,
on the part of the plaintiff, was Dr. Tunstal,
who closed his evidence by describing a case of delirium
tremens treated by him, in which the patient
recovered in a single night. 'It was,' said the
witness, 'a case of gradual drinking, sipping all
day, from morning till night.' These words were
scarcely uttered, than Mr. Chambers, turning to the
Bench, said, 'My Lord, that is my case.'"</p>


<h3>TURNING-POINT IN PALEY'S CAREER.</h3>

<p>When Paley first went to Cambridge, he fell into a
society of young men far richer than himself, to
whom his talents and conviviality made him an
acceptable companion, and he was in a fair way
for ruin. One morning one of these comrades came
into his bedroom before he was up, and he, as usual,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
thought it was to propose some plan of pleasure for
the day. His friend, however, said, "Paley, I have
not slept a wink this night for thinking of you. I
am, as you know, heir to such and such a fortune,
and whether I ever look in a book at Cambridge does
not signify a farthing. But this is not the case with
you. You have only your abilities to look to; and
no man has better, if you do but make the proper
use of them. But if you go on in this way, you are
ruined; and from this time forward I am determined
not to associate with you, for your own sake. You
know I like your company, and it is a great sacrifice
to give it up; but give it up I will, as a matter of
conscience." Paley lay in bed the whole day, ruminating
upon this. In the evening he rose and took
his tea, ordered his bed-maker to make his fire overnight,
and call him at five in the morning; and from
that day forward he rose always at that hour. He
went out first wrangler, and became the fortunate
man he was. This story was told to Southey in
1808, by Mr. Brome, who had it from an intimate
friend of Paley.</p>


<h3>THE DANGERS OF TOO GOOD COMPANY.</h3>

<p>George I. liked to temper the cares of royalty with
the pleasures of private life, and commonly invited
six or eight friends to pass the evening with him.
His Majesty seeing Dr. Lockier one day at court,
desired the Duchess of Ancaster, who was almost
always of the party, to ask the Doctor to come that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
evening. When the company met in the evening,
Dr. Lockier was not there; and the King inquired of
the Duchess if she had invited him. "Yes," she said;
"but the Doctor presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and hopes your Majesty will have the goodness
to excuse him at present; he is soliciting some
preferment from your Majesty's Ministers, and fears
it may be some obstacle to him, if it should be
known that he had the honour of keeping such good
company." The King laughed very heartily, and said
he believed he was in the right. Not many weeks
after, Dr. Lockier kissed the King's hand as Dean of
Peterborough; and as he was rising from kneeling,
the King inclined forwards, and with great good-humour
whispered in his ear, "Well, now, Doctor,
you will not be afraid to come in an evening; I
would have you come this evening;" an invitation
which was very readily accepted.</p>


<h3>ANECDOTES OF ABERNETHY.</h3>

<p>John Abernethy, the pupil and friend of John
Hunter, was remarkable for eccentricity and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brusquerie</i>
in his dealings with patients. But there are
many instances to show that his roughness was only
external, and that a very soft and gentle heart beat
in his bosom. He was sometimes successfully combated
with his own weapons. A lady on one occasion
entered his consulting-room, and showed him
an injured finger, without saying a word. In silence
Abernethy dressed the wound; silently the lady put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the usual fee on the table, and retired. In a few
days she came again, and offered the finger for inspection.
"Better?" asked the surgeon. "Better,"
answered the lady, speaking for the first time. Not
another word followed during the interview. Three
or four visits were made, in the last of which the
patient held out her finger perfectly healed. "Well?"
was Abernethy's inquiry. "Well," was the lady's
answer. "Upon my soul, madam," exclaimed the
delighted surgeon, "<em>you are the most rational woman
I ever met with</em>!" "I had heard of your rudeness
before I came, Sir," another and less fortunate lady
said, taking his prescription; "but I was not prepared
for such treatment. What am I to do with
this?" "Anything you like," the surgeon roughly
answered. "Put it on the fire if you please." Taking
him at his word, the lady put her fee on the
table, and the prescription on the fire, and, making
a bow, left the room. Abernethy followed her,
apologizing, and begging her to take back the fee
or let him write another prescription; but the lady
would not relent. When the bubble schemes were
flourishing in 1825, Mr. Abernethy met some friends
who had risked large sums of money in one of those
speculations; they informed him that they were
going to partake of a most sumptuous dinner, the
expenses of which would be defrayed by the company.
"If I am not very much deceived," replied
he, "you will have nothing but bubble and squeak
in a short time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>


<h3>BLOMFIELD'S REBUKE TO NON-RESIDENT
RECTORS.</h3>

<p>Dr. Blomfield, Bishop of London, had occasion to
call the attention of the Essex incumbents to the
necessity of residing in their parishes; and he reminded
them that curates were, after all, of the same
flesh and blood as rectors, and that the residence
which was possible for the one, could not be quite
impossible for the other. "Besides," added he,
"there are two well-known preservatives against
ague: the one is, a good deal of care and a little port
wine; the other, a little care and a good deal of port
wine. I prefer the former; but if any of the clergy
prefer the latter, it is at all events a remedy which
incumbents can afford better than curates."</p>


<h3>DEVOTION OF A CATHOLIC PRIEST.</h3>

<p>In a parish close to Dublin, it is on record that a
Catholic priest was called on to administer the solemn
rites of his religion to a family in the last stage of
typhus fever. The family, six or seven in number,
were found lying in a wretched hovel, on a little
straw scattered on the damp earthen floor. The
agonies of death were fast coming upon them. The
confession of each one of them had to be heard.
Lest any should overhear the confession of another,
the priest stretched himself on the straw, while the
miserable sufferer breathed his or her confession into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
his ear. Thus, inhaling the poison of their respiration,
and separating them from each other successively,
at the risk of his own life, he completed his
sacred functions.</p>


<h3>PULPIT JOKES OF DANIEL BURGESS.</h3>

<p>Daniel Burgess, the noted Nonconformist minister,
was by no means of Puritan strictness, for he was
the most facetious person of his day, and carried his
wit so far as to retail it from the pulpit with more
levity than decency. Speaking of Job's "robe of
righteousness," he once said, "If any of you would
have a suit for a twelvemonth, let him repair to
Monmouth Street; if for his lifetime, let him apply
to the Court of Chancery; but if for all eternity, let
him put on the robe of righteousness." The sermons
of Burgess were adapted to the prejudices as well as
the opinions of his hearers&mdash;wit and Whiggism went
hand in hand with Scripture. He was strongly
attached to the House of Brunswick, and would not
uphold the Pretender's cause from the pulpit. He
once preached a sermon, about that time, on the
reason why the Jews were called Jacobites, in which
he said, "God ever hated Jacobites, and therefore
Jacob's sons were not so called, but Israelites!"</p>


<h3>PHYSICIANS AND THEIR FEES.</h3>

<p>Perhaps regarding nothing connected with the science
and practice of medicine, or the lives of its professors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
are there more stories told, more curious facts on
record, more interesting exhibitions of character and
touching displays of generosity to relate, than about
the giving and taking&mdash;or not taking&mdash;of fees. In
stringing together some memoranda and anecdotes
on this head, it needs only to be said that they are
but a few out of a crowd. At the outset, it may be
explained that from very early times the fee of the
physician (like that of the advocate or the university
professor) was regarded in the light of a voluntary
recognition or reward for services rendered out of
pure love of science or humanity. Dr. Doran alleges,
indeed, that "there is a religious reason why fees are
supposed not to be taken by physicians. Amongst
the Christian martyrs are reckoned the two eastern
brothers, Damian and Cosmas. They practised as
physicians in Cilicia, and they were the first mortal
practitioners who refused to take recompense for
their work. Hence they were called Anargyri, or
'without money.' All physicians are pleasantly
supposed to follow this example. They never take
fees, like Damian and Cosmas; but they meekly
receive what they know will be given out of Christian
humility, and with a certain or uncertain reluctance,
which is the nearest approach that can be
made in these times to the two brothers who were
in partnership at Egea in Cilicia." It has very
naturally, however, been objected that physicians
act from no such lofty motives, but merely because
they prefer that the gratitude or the fears of the
patient should be the measure of their reward. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
yet, as Mr. Wadd forcibly remarks, "it is a fact, not
less singular than true, that the advancement of
surgical science is a benefit conferred on society at
the expense of the scientific practitioner, since in
proportion as the mode of cure is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tuto et celeriter</i>,
safe and speedy, remuneration is diminished. Perhaps
in no instance is this better exemplified than
in the operation of the hydrocele, introduced by my
late friend and master, Sir James Earle. Compare
the simplicity, safety, and celerity of this, with the
bustle and bloody brutality of the old system; the
business of six weeks reduced to so many days! But
mark the consequence, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quâ honorarium</i>: does the
patient increase the fee for the pain and misery he
is spared? Not a bit of it. Here is little or no
work done; no trouble to the doctor; no pain to
the patient; therefore, nothing to pay for....
Selden, who understood these failings in mankind
vastly well, gives them a sly hit in his <cite>Table Talk</cite>:&mdash;'If
a man had a sore leg, and he should go to an
honest, judicious chirurgeon, and he should only bid
him keep it warm, and anoint it with such an oil (an
oil well known) that would do the cure, haply he
would not much regard him, because he knows the
medicine beforehand, an ordinary medicine. But if
he should go to a surgeon that should tell him, your
leg will gangrene within three days and it must be
cut off, and you will die unless you do something
that I could tell you, what listening there would be
to this man! Oh, for the Lord's sake, tell me what
this is, I will give you any content for your pains!'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Not only has this loss of reward through the devising
of new appliances for preventing human suffering,
not made medical men, as a rule, one whit less anxious
to devise them, or adopt them when devised; but it
is in the experience of all, that in many cases physicians
can render services gratuitously, which they
would never have had the opportunity of rendering
if it was not understood, both by themselves and the
suffering, that they gave their skill cheerfully for
God's sake as for gold's sake, to those who were unable
to appeal to the latter power.</p>

<p><i>Ancient Fees of Magnitude.</i>&mdash;Seleucus&mdash;the one of
Alexander's generals to whom the kingdom of Syria
fell at the break-up of the empire of Macedonian
conquest&mdash;gave to Erasistratus 60,000 crowns "for
discovering the disorder of his son Antiochus." Alcon,
whose dexterity is celebrated in Martial's <cite>Epigrams</cite>,
was repaid by the public, in the course of a few
years' practice, the sum of 10,000,000 sesterces
(£80,000) which he had lost by a law-suit. Four
Roman physicians, Aruntius, Calpetanus, Rubrius,
and Albutius, for their attendance on Augustus and
his two immediate successors, enjoyed each an annual
salary of 250,000 sesterces, equal to £2000 sterling.</p>

<p><i>Early English Fees.</i>&mdash;In 1345, Edward III. granted
to his apothecary, Coursus de Gungeland, a pension
of sixpence a-day; and "Ricardus Wye, chirurgicus,"
had twelve pence per day, and eight marks per year,
for his services. Under the same king, "Willielmus
Holme, chirurgicus Regis," is rewarded with the permission,
during his lifetime, "to hunt, take, and carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
off wild animals of all kinds, in any of the royal
forests, chases, parks, and warrens." In the Courts
of the kings of Wales, the physician or surgeon was
the twelfth person in rank, and his fees seem to have
been fixed by law. For a flesh wound, not of a dangerous
character, he got nothing but such of the
wounded man's garments as the blood had stained;
but for any of the three classes of dangerous wounds,
he had in addition 180 pence, and his maintenance
so long as his services might be in requisition.</p>

<p><i>Fees in the reign of Henry VIII. and Elizabeth.</i>&mdash;In
the record of expenses of the Earl of Cumberland,
it is stated that he paid to a physician of Cambridge
£1; but this fee was evidently, as shown by other
entries, an exceptionally liberal one, even perhaps
for a noble to pay. In the 18th year of Henry VIII.,
as is mentioned in Burn's <cite>History of Westmoreland</cite>,
Sir Walter Strickland made a bargain with a physician
to cure him of an asthma for £20. Stow, in the
same reign, complimenting British physicians on
their skill and learning, mentions "as the great grievance
that the inferior people are undone by the exorbitance
of their fees." Half-a-crown, he avers, is
in Holland looked on as a large fee; whereas in
England "a physician scorns to touch any metal but
gold; and our surgeons are still more unreasonable."
Queen Elizabeth's physician in ordinary received £100
per annum, besides his sustenance, wine, wax, and
other necessaries or perquisites. Her apothecary,
Hugo Morgan, for one quarter's bill had £83, 7s. 8d.;
but this was not all for medicines, as such entries as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
this will show:&mdash;eleven shillings for a confection
shaped like a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">manus Christi</i>, with bezoar stone and
unicorn's horn; sixteenpence for a royal sweetmeat
with incised rhubarb; six shillings for "a conserve
of barberries, with preserved damascene plums, and
other things for Mr. Ralegh;" two shillings and
sixpence for sweet scent to be used at the christening
of Sir Richard Knightley's son; and so on.</p>

<p><i>Fees after the Revolution.</i>&mdash;At the close of the sixteenth
and opening of the seventeenth century, the
fee of the physician had tended towards fixity, as regards
the <em>minimum</em> at least, which was ten shillings.
This appears from several incidental contemporary
statements, as in the satirical dialogue of "Physick
lies a-bleeding; or the Apothecary turned Doctor"
(published in 1697, during the war of the "Dispensary"),
in which one of the characters, called on to
pay eighteen shillings for medicine for his wife and
a crown by way of gratuity to the apothecary, says:
"I wish you had called a doctor; perhaps he would
have advised her to have forbore taking anything,
at least as yet, so I had saved 13s. in my pocket."
In 1700, as appears from the <cite>Levamen Infirmi</cite>, the
existence of <em>minimum</em> and <em>maximum</em> fees appears to
have been quite recognised:&mdash;"To a graduate in
physick, his due is about ten shillings, though he
commonly expects or demands twenty. Those that
are only licensed physicians, their due is no more
than six shillings and eightpence, though they commonly
demand ten shillings. A surgeon's fee is
twelve-pence a mile, be his journey far or near; ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
groats to set a bone broke, or out of joint; and for
letting blood, one shilling; the cutting off or amputation
of any limb is five pounds, but there is no
settled price for the cure."</p>

<p><i>Sir Theodore Mayerne.</i>&mdash;This eminent physician,
who was a native of Geneva, and attended James I.
and the two Charleses, once very neatly and deservedly
rebuked a mean and ostentatious friend,
who, after consulting him, laid on the table two
broad pieces of gold (of the value of 36s. each). Sir
Theodore quietly pocketed the fee; and, on his friend
expressing or showing himself hurt at thus being
taken at his money, said to him: "I made my will
this morning; and if it should appear that I had
refused a fee, I might be deemed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non compos</i>." Mr.
Wadd caps this anecdote with another about Dr.
Meyer Schomberg, who was much in vogue about the
middle of last century. Mr. Martin, the surgeon,
used now and then to visit him; and was once shown
in when a patient was with him. After the patient
was gone, Martin noticed two guineas lying on the
table, and asked the doctor how it came that he left
his money about in that way? Said Dr. Schomberg:
"I always have a couple of guineas before me, as an
example, or broad hint, what they (the patients who
consulted him) ought to give."</p>

<p><i>Large Royal Fees in Later Times.</i>&mdash;Henry Atkins
was sent for to Scotland by James the First (of
England), to attend to the Prince Charles&mdash;afterwards
Charles I., but then in his infancy&mdash;who lay dangerously
sick. For this journey and duty the King gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Atkins the splendid fee of £6000, which he invested
in the purchase of the manor of Clapham. In 1685 a
very handsome fee was ordered to be paid&mdash;but it was
never paid&mdash;to Dr. King, for a brave breach of Court
etiquette that saved the life of Charles II. for a time.
Evelyn thus relates the incident, under date 4th
February 1685:&mdash;"I went to London, hearing his
Majesty had been, the Monday before (2 Feb.), surprised
in his bed-chamber with an apoplectic fit; so
that if, by God's providence, Dr. King (that excellent
chirurgeon as well as physician) had not been actually
present, to let him blood (having his lancet in
his pocket), his Majesty had certainly died that moment,
which might have been of direful consequence,
there being nobody else present with the king save
this doctor and one more, as I am assured. It was a
mark of the extraordinary dexterity, resolution, and
presence of mind in the Dr. to let him blood in the
very paroxysm, without staying the coming of other
physicians; which regularly should have been done,
and for want of which he must have a regular pardon,
as they tell me." The Privy Council ordered £1000
to be given to Dr. King; but he never obtained the
money. The physicians who attended Queen Caroline
in 1737 had 500 guineas, and the surgeons 300
guineas, apiece. Dr. Willis, for his success in dealing
with the malady of George III., received £1500
a-year for twenty years, and £650 was settled on his
son for life; the subordinate physicians had thirty
guineas for each visit to Windsor, and ten for each
visit to Kew. The Empress Catherine of Russia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
made Dr. Dimsdale&mdash;a Hertfordshire physician&mdash;who,
in 1768, travelled to St. Petersburg to inoculate her
and her son, a Baron of the Empire; and presented
him with a fee of £12,000, and a life pension of £500.
This sum of £12,000 is about the largest ever paid,
in ancient times or modern, to one physician for one
operation; although there are living surgeons who
from private individuals have received fees that
dwarf this imperial largess into comparative insignificance.
Perhaps even more remarkable, however, than
Catherine's liberal payment for good work, was the
Emperor Joseph of Austria's reward for bad news.
On his deathbed his Majesty asked Quarin his opinion
of his case, and was frankly assured, in reply, that
he could not expect to live other forty-eight hours.
For this uncourtly but really kind affirmation of the
truth, the Emperor created Quarin a Baron, and conferred
on him an income of £2000. Louis XIV.
gave his physician and surgeon 75,000 crowns each,
after the successful performance of a painful, and at
that time novel, operation. Beside this, the fees paid
by Napoleon I. to the Faculty who attended Marie
Louise in March 1811, when the Emperor's son was
born, are trifling. Dubois, Corvisart, Bourdier, and
Ivan, had amongst them a remuneration of £4000,
£2000 being the portion assigned to Dubois.</p>

<p><i>Fee for a Political Consultation.</i>&mdash;At the outbreak
of the American war, Grenville was desirous to ascertain
what was the state of feeling that prevailed
among the Quaker colonists in America; and he
could hit, as he thought, on no more effectual means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of doing this, than by a conversation with Dr. Fothergill,
who was a Quaker, and enjoyed the hearty confidence
of his brethren of that sect. Fothergill was
accordingly summoned to prescribe for the statesman&mdash;who,
in reality, wanted to feel, through him,
the pulse of transatlantic Quakerism; and the visit,
of course, was made to take the turn of a vivacious
controversy on American politics. At the end,
Grenville put five guineas into the doctor's hand,
and said to him, "Really, I feel so much better, that
I don't think it is necessary for you to prescribe."
With a shrewd smile, Fothergill, keeping a good hold
of the money, said, "Well, at this rate, friend, I can
spare thee an hour now and then."</p>

<p><i>Generous Refusal of Fees.</i>&mdash;There are many anecdotes
of refusal of physicians to take fees from persons
whom the payment of them would have distressed;
but they are all so nobly alike, that we need
not quote any here. The benevolent and eccentric
Dr. Smith, when established in a practice equal to
that of any physician in London, did what perhaps
few physicians in great practice would have done.
He set apart <em>two days for the poor in each week</em>.
From those who were really poor, he never took a
fee; and from those who were of the middling ranks
in life, he never would take above half a guinea!
Yet so great was the resort to him, that he has in
one day received fifty guineas, at the rate of half a
guinea only from each patient.</p>

<p><i>Sticklers for Fees.</i>&mdash;Sir Richard Jebb was once paid
three guineas by a nobleman from whom he had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
right to expect five. Sir Richard dropped the coins
on the carpet, when a servant picked them up and
restored them. Sir Richard continued his search.
"Are all the guineas found?" asked his Lordship,
looking round. "There must be two still on the
floor," was Jebb's answer; "for I have only three."
The hint was taken, and the right sum put down.
An eminent Bristol doctor coming into his patient's
bedroom immediately after death, found the right
hand of the deceased tightly clenched. Opening the
fingers, he discovered within them a guinea. "Ah!
that was for me, clearly," said the doctor, putting
the piece into his pocket. A physician, receiving
two guineas when he expected three, from an old
lady who used to give him the latter fee, had recourse
to one part of Sir Richard Jebb's artifice, and,
assuming that the third guinea had been dropt through
his carelessness on the floor, looked about for it.
"Nay, nay," said the lady, "you are not in fault.
It is I who dropt it."</p>

<p><i>Fees collectively Irresistible.</i>&mdash;Radcliffe attended a
friend for a twelvemonth gratuitously. On his last
visit his friend said, "Doctor, here is a purse in
which I have put every day's fee; and your goodness
must not get the better of my gratitude. Take your
money." Radcliffe steeled himself to persevere in benevolence,
just touched the purse to reject it, heard
the chink of the gold, and put it into his pocket,
saying "Singly, Sir, I could have refused them for a
twelvemonth; but, all together, they are <em>irresistible</em>."</p>

<h3>PALEY'S ECONOMY OF CONSCIENCE.</h3>

<p>The great controversy on the propriety of requiring
a subscription to articles of faith, as practised by the
Church of England, excited in 1772 a very strong
sensation amongst the members of the two universities.
Paley, when pressed to sign the clerical petition
which was presented to the House of Commons
for relief, excused himself, saying, "He could not
<em>afford</em> to keep a conscience."</p>


<h3>DIFFIDENCE IN THE PULPIT.</h3>

<p>Izaak Walton relates about Bishop Sanderson, that
once "his dear and most intimate friend, the learned
Dr. Hammond, came to enjoy a quiet rest and conversation
with him for some days at Boothby Pannel,
and did so, and having formerly persuaded him to
trust his excellent memory, and not read, but try to
speak a sermon as he had writ it; Dr. Sanderson
became so compliant as to promise that he would.
And to that end they two went early the Sunday
following to a neighbour minister, and requested to
exchange a sermon; and they did so. And at Dr.
Sanderson's going into the pulpit, he gave his sermon
(which was a very short one) into the hands of Dr.
Hammond, intending to preach it as it was writ;
but before he had preached a third part, Dr. Hammond
(looking on his sermon as written) observed
him to be out, and so lost as to the matter, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the method, that he also became afraid for him; for
it was discernible to many of that plain auditory.
But when he had ended this short sermon, as they
two walked homeward, Dr. Sanderson said with
much earnestness, 'Good Doctor, give me my sermon,
and know that neither you, nor any man living,
shall ever persuade me to preach again without my
books.' To which the reply was, 'Good Doctor, be
not angry; for if ever I persuade you to preach
again without book, I will give you leave to burn
all the books that I am master of.'" Elsewhere
Walton says:&mdash;"Though they were much esteemed
by them that procured and were fit to judge them,
yet (Dr. Sanderson's sermons) were the less valued
because he read them, which he was forced to do;
for though he had an extraordinary memory (even
the art of it), yet he was punished with such an
innate, invincible fear and bashfulness, that his memory
was wholly useless as to the repetition of his
sermons, so as he had writ them; which gave occasion
to say, when some of them were first printed
and exposed to censure (which was in the year 1632),
that the best sermons that ever were read were
never preached." Aubrey says, that when he was
a freshman at college, and heard Dr. Sanderson read
his first lecture, he was out in the Lord's Prayer.</p>


<h3>CHRISTIAN NAMES AMONG THE PURITANS.</h3>

<p>In his <cite>Church History</cite>, Collins says:&mdash;"Under the
article of Baptism, the Book of Discipline runs thus:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
'Let persuasions be used that such names that do
savour either of Paganism or Popery be not given
to children at their baptism, but principally those
whereof there are examples in the Scriptures.' The
Puritans were strict in keeping close to this rule, as
may be collected from the odd names they gave their
children; such as, 'The Lord is Near,' 'More Trial,'
'Reformation,' 'Discipline,' 'Joy Again,' 'Sufficient
from Above,' 'Free-Gifts,' 'More Fruit,' 'Dust,' etc.
And here Snape was remarkably scrupulous; for this
minister refused to baptize one Christopher Hodgkinson's
child, because he would have it christened
Richard. Snape acquainted Hodgkinson with his
opinion beforehand. He told him he must change the
name, and look out for one in the Scripture; but the
father, not thinking this fancy would be so strongly
insisted on, brought his son to church. Snape proceeded
in the solemnity till he came to naming the
child; but not being able to prevail for any other
name than Richard, refused to administer the sacrament,
and thus the child was carried away, and
afterwards baptized by a conforming clergyman."</p>


<h3>"WHAT IS AN ARCHDEACON?"</h3>

<p>Lord Althorp, when Chancellor of the Exchequer,
having to propose to the House of Commons a vote
of £400 a year for the salary of the Archdeacon of
Bengal, was puzzled by a question from Mr. Hume,
"What are the duties of an archdeacon?" So he
sent one of the subordinate occupants of the Treasury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Bench to the other House to obtain an answer
to the question from one of the bishops. To Dr.
Blomfield accordingly the messenger went, and repeated
the question, "What is an archdeacon?"
"An archdeacon," replied the bishop, in his quick
way, "an archdeacon is an ecclesiastical officer, who
performs archidiaconal functions;" and with this
reply Lord Althorp and the House were perfectly
satisfied.</p>


<h3>"TAPPING" A TOPER.</h3>

<p>A man who had never drunk water enough to
warrant the disease, was reduced to such a state
by dropsy, that the physicians decided that tapping
was necessary; and the poor patient was invited
to submit to the operation, which he seemed
inclined to do, in spite of the entreaties of his son.
"Oh! father, father, do not let them <em>tap</em> you,"
screamed the boy, in an agony of tears; "do anything,
but do not let them tap you!" "Why, my
dear?" inquired the afflicted parent. "It will do me
good, and I shall live long in health to make you
happy." "No, father, no, you will not: there never
was anything <em>tapped</em> in our house that lasted longer
than a week!"</p>


<h3>THE CAPACITY OF AN ABBE.</h3>

<p>When the diminutive Abbé de Voisenon was ordered
by his physician to drink a quart of ptisan per hour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
he was horrified. On his next visit the doctor asked,
"What effect has the ptisan produced?" "Not
any," answered the little Abbé. "Have you taken
it all?" "I could not take more than half of it."
The physician was angry that his directions had not
been carried out, and frankly said so. "Ah! my
friend," pleaded the Abbé, "how could you desire
me to swallow a quart an hour? I hold but a pint!"</p>


<h3>BENEFIT OF CLERGY.</h3>

<p>In Burnet's <cite>History of the Reformation</cite>, we find it
stated that "a law of Henry VII. for burning in
the hand clerks convicted of felony, did not prove
a sufficient restraint. And when, in the fourth year
of the following reign, it was enacted that all murderers
and robbers should be denied the benefit of
their clergy, two provisos were added to make the
bill pass through the House of Lords, the one for
excepting all such as were within the holy orders of
bishop, priest, or deacon, and the other, that the Act
should only be in force till the next Parliament.
Pursuant to this Act many murderers and felons
were denied their clergy, and the law passed on
them to the great satisfaction of the nation; but
this gave great offence to the clergy, and the Abbot
of Winchelcont said, in a sermon at Paul's Cross, that
the Act was contrary to the law of God, and to the
liberties of the holy Church, and that all who assented
to it had by so doing incurred the censures of the
Church."</p>

<h3>DEAN SWIFT'S CONTRIBUTORY DINNER.</h3>

<p>Dean Swift once invited to dinner several of the
first noblemen and gentlemen in Dublin. A servant
announced the dinner, and the Dean led the way to
the dining-room. To each chair was a servant, a
bottle of wine, a roll, and an inverted plate. On
taking his seat, the Dean desired the guests to arrange
themselves according to their own ideas of precedence,
and fall to. The company were astonished to
find the table without a dish, or any provisions. The
Lord Chancellor, who was present, said, "Mr. Dean,
we do not see the joke." "Then I will show it you,"
answered the Dean, turning up his plate, under which
was half-a-crown, and a bill of fare from a neighbouring
tavern. "Here, sir," said he, to his servant,
"bring me a plate of goose." The company
caught the idea, and each man sent his plate and
half-a-crown. Covers, with everything that the appetites
of the moment dictated, soon appeared. The
novelty, the peculiarity of the manner, and the unexpected
circumstances, altogether excited the plaudits
of the noble guests, who declared themselves particularly
gratified by the Dean's entertainment. "Well,"
said the Dean, "gentlemen, if you have dined, I will
order the <em>dessert</em>." A large roll of paper, presenting
the particulars of a splendid dinner, was produced,
with an estimate of the expense. The Dean requested
the accountant-general to deduct the half-crowns
from the amount, observing, "that as his noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
guests were pleased to express their satisfaction with
the dinner, he begged their advice and assistance in
disposing of the <em>fragments</em> and <em>crumbs</em>," as he termed
the balance mentioned by the accountant-general&mdash;which
was two hundred and fifty pounds. The company
said, that no person was capable of instructing
the Dean in things of that nature. After the circulation
of the finest wines, the most judicious remarks
on charity and its abuse were introduced, and it was
agreed that the proper objects of liberal relief were
well-educated families, who from affluence, or the
expectation of it, were reduced through misfortune
to silent despair. The Dean then divided the sum
by the number of his guests, and addressed them
according to their respective private characters, with
which no one was perhaps better acquainted. "You,
my Lords," said the Dean to several young noblemen,
"I wish to introduce to some new acquaintance,
who will at least make their acknowledgment
for your favours with sincerity." "You, my reverend
Lords," addressing the bishops present, "adhere so
closely to the spirit of the Scriptures, that your left
hands are literally ignorant of the beneficence of
your right. You, my Lord of Kildare, and the two
noble lords near you, I will not entrust with any
part of this money, as you have been long in the
<em>usurious</em> habits of lending your own on such occasions;
but your assistance, my Lord of Kerry, I
must entreat, as charity covereth a multitude of
sins."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>


<h3>"BREAKING UP" BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS.</h3>

<p>It is related that Dr. Harrington of Bath, the Editor
of <cite>Nugæ Antiquæ</cite>, for many years attended the
Dowager Lady Trevor, relict of Lord Trevor, and
last surviving daughter of Sir Richard Steele. "He
spoke of this lady as possessing all the wit, humour,
and gaiety of her father, together with most of his
faults. She was extravagant, and always in debt;
but she was generous, charitable, and humane. She
was particularly partial to young people, whom she
frequently entertained most liberally, and delighted
them with the pleasantry and volubility of her discourse.
Her person was like that which her pleasant
father described himself in the <cite>Spectator</cite>, with his
short face, etc. A little before her death (which was
in the month of December) she sent for her doctor,
and, on his entering her chamber, he said, 'How
fares your Ladyship?' She replied, 'Oh, my dear
Doctor, ill fare! I am going to break up before the
holidays!'"</p>


<h3>BOTTLE BLIND.</h3>

<p>Dean Cowper, of Durham, was very economical of
his wine. One day at table he was descanting on
the extraordinary performance of a man who was
blind, and remarked that the poor fellow could see
no more than "that bottle." "I do not wonder at
that at all, Sir," replied a minor canon; "for we have
seen no more than <em>that bottle</em> all the afternoon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>


<h3>FEARLESSNESS OF JOHN KNOX.</h3>

<p>When Lord Darnley, in 1565, had married Mary
Queen of Scots, he was prevailed on by his friends to
go and hear Knox preach, in the hope that thereby
he might conciliate the stem moralist and outspoken
minister. But Knox seized the occasion to declaim
even more vehemently against the government of
wicked princes, who, for the sins of the people,
are sent as tyrants and scourges to torment them.
Darnley complained to the Council of the insult;
and the bold preacher was forbidden the use of his
pulpit for several days. Robertson thus remarks on
his character:&mdash;"Rigid and uncomplying himself, he
showed no regard to the infirmities of others. Regardless
of the distinctions of rank and character, he
uttered his admonitions with acrimony and vehemence,
more apt to irritate than to reclaim. Those very
qualities, however, which now render his character
less amiable, fitted him to be the instrument of Providence
for advancing the Reformation among a fierce
people, and enabled him to face dangers, and to surmount
opposition, from which a person of a more
gentle spirit would have been apt to shrink back."
The shortest and perhaps the best funeral oration
extant, is that pronounced by the Earl of Morton
over the grave of Knox: "Here lies he who never
feared the face of man."</p>

<h3>WESLEY AND BEAU NASH.</h3>

<p>Wesley once preaching at Bath, Beau Nash entered
the room, came close up to the preacher, and demanded
by what authority he was acting? Wesley
answered, "By the authority of Jesus Christ, conveyed
to me by the present Archbishop of Canterbury,
when he laid his hands upon me and said,
'Take thou authority to preach the gospel.'" Nash
then affirmed that he was acting contrary to the law.
"Besides," said he, "your preaching frightens people
out of their wits." "Sir," replied Wesley, "did you
ever hear me preach?" "No," said the master of
the ceremonies. "How, then, can you judge of
what you have never heard?" "By common report,"
said Nash. "Sir," retorted Wesley, "is not your
name Nash? I dare not judge of you by common
report; I think it not enough to judge by." Nash,
right or wrong as to the extravagances of the Methodists,
was certainly proclaiming his opinions in the
wrong place; and when he desired to know what the
people came there for, one of the company cried out:
"Let an old woman answer him. You, Mr. Nash,
take care of your body, we take care of our souls,
and for the food of our souls we come here." Nash
found himself so different a man in the meeting-house,
to what he was in the pump-room or the assembly,
that he thought it best to withdraw.</p>

<h3>THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE BIBLE.</h3>

<p>In Silliman's <cite>Travels</cite> it is related that during the
Peace of Amiens, in 1801-2, a committee of English
gentlemen went over to Paris for the purpose of
taking measures to supply the French with the Bible
in their own language. One of these gentlemen, Mr.
Hardcastle, subsequently gave the assurance that the
fact which was published was literally true&mdash;that they
searched Paris for several days before a single Bible
could be found.</p>


<h3>EDWARD JENNER, THE DISCOVERER OF
VACCINATION.</h3>

<p>It is to a "country doctor" that England and the world
owe one of the greatest benefits that modern medical
science has conferred on the race, in the practice of
vaccination. The youngest son of a Gloucestershire
clergyman, Edward Jenner was placed, about 1763,
as apprentice to a surgeon at Sodbury; and it was
there, it is stated, that first the possibility of arresting
the then dreaded and dreadful ravages of small-pox
entered his mind. He accidentally learned, from
the conversation of a young serving woman&mdash;who
boasted that she was safe from that disease because
she had had "cow-pox"&mdash;that among servants in
the country there prevailed a belief that the small-pox
could not attack any one into whose system had
been absorbed the virus from a diseased cow. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
that time Jenner never lost sight of the idea. He
spent some time in London finishing his studies, under
the prelections of John Hunter; and then he settled,
for life as it proved, at Berkeley, in Gloucestershire.
Pursuing inquiries and experiments on the
subject of vaccination, he established the efficacy of
the rural system of inducing "cow-pox" as a preventive
against small-pox; which had originated by
inoculation, accidental or designed, with some of the
matter afforded by a peculiar disease of the udder of
a cow, and which could be communicated by inoculation
from one human being to another with
the same preventive efficacy. In 1796, a friend of
Jenner's, to whom he had communicated the results
of his inquiry&mdash;Mr. Cline, surgeon to St. Thomas's
Hospital&mdash;first employed vaccination in London; and
the practice was speedily adopted in the army and
navy, the Government bestowing on Jenner honours
and rewards, and the University of Oxford conferring
on him the diploma of Doctor of Medicine. Just,
however, as Blackmore and Tanner had vehemently
opposed inoculation, so did many members of the
Faculty, foremost among them Moseley, Birch, and
Woodville, oppose the new system of vaccination.
The London mob were asked and induced to believe
that if they submitted to vaccination they were in
jeopardy of being converted into members of the
canine species, and that the operation would infallibly
be followed by the development of horns, and tail,
and "thick natural fell" of hair. A child was said
to have never ceased, since he received the matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
into his system, to run about on all fours and imitate
the lowing of a bull! In a caricature Jenner was
mounted on a cow. Moseley indited verses, of which
this is a sample:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O Jenner! thy book, nightly phantasies rousing,<br /></span>

<p>Even in Berkeley, Jenner was pursued with ridicule
and suspicion; but he went quietly on his rounds,
waiting confidently till the storm was laid, plashing
through the Gloucestershire lanes in the garb that an
acquaintance has thus described:&mdash;"He was dressed
in a blue coat and yellow buttons, buckskins, well-polished
jockey-boots, with handsome silver spurs,
and he carried a smart whip with a silver handle.
His hair, after the fashion, was done up in a club,
and he wore a broad-brimmed hat." But Jenner,
says Mr. Jeaffreson, found also compensation for all
the ridicule and opposition "in the enthusiastic support
of Rowland Hill, who not only advocated vaccination
in his ordinary conversation, but from the
pulpit used to say, after his sermon to his congregation,
wherever he preached, 'I am ready to vaccinate
to-morrow morning as many children as you
choose; and if you wish them to escape that horrid
disease, the small-pox, you will bring them.' A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Vaccine Board was also established at the Surrey
Chapel&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the Octagon Chapel, in Blackfriars Road.
'My Lord,' said Rowland Hill once to a nobleman,
'allow me to present to your Lordship my friend, Dr.
Jenner, who has been the means of saving more lives
than any other man.' 'Ah!' observed Jenner, 'would
that I, like you, could say&mdash;souls.' There was no
cant in this. Jenner was a simple, unaffected, and
devout man. His last words were, 'I do not marvel
that men are grateful to me; but I am surprised that
they do not feel gratitude to God for making me a
medium of good.'"</p>


<h3>ANGEL-WORSHIP.</h3>

<p>A now obsolete ecclesiastical custom in Scotland was,
Dean Ramsay says, that the minister should bow in
succession to the heritors or proprietors in the parish,
who occupied the front gallery seats; a custom, when
the position of the heritors was tolerably well matched,
that led to an unpleasant contest at times as to who
was entitled to the precedence of getting the first bow.
A clever and complimentary reply was made by Dr.
Wightman of Kirkmahoe, when rallied on one occasion
for neglecting this usual act of courtesy one Sunday.
The heritor who was entitled to, and always received,
this token of respect, was Miller of Dalswinton.
One Sunday, the Dalswinton pew was filled by a
bevy of ladies, but no gentleman was present; and
the Doctor&mdash;perhaps because he was a bachelor, and
felt a delicacy in the circumstances&mdash;omitted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
usual salaam in that direction. A few days after,
meeting Miss Miller (who was widely famed for her
beauty, and afterwards became Countess of Mar),
she rallied him, in presence of her companions, for
not bowing to her on the Sunday. The Doctor immediately
replied, "I beg your pardon, Miss Miller;
but you know, surely, that angel-worship is not
allowed by the Church of Scotland;" and, lifting his
hat, he bowed low and passed on.</p>


<h3>BUNYAN'S SUCCESSFUL AND PRESISTENT
PREACHING.</h3>

<p>A student of Cambridge observing a multitude flock
to a village church on a working day, inquired what
was the cause. On being informed that "one Bunyan,
a tinker," was to preach there, he gave a boy a few
halfpence to hold his horse, resolved, as he said, "to
hear the tinker prate." The tinker <em>prated</em> to such
effect, that for some time the scholar wished to hear
no other preacher; and, through his future life, gave
proofs of the advantages he had received from the
humble ministry of the author of the <cite>Pilgrim's
Progress</cite>. Bunyan, with rude but irresistible zeal,
preached throughout the country, and formed the
greater part of the Baptist churches in Bedfordshire;
until, at the Restoration, he was thrown into prison,
where he remained twelve years. During his confinement
he preached to all to whom he could gain
access; and when liberty was offered to him on condition
of promising to abstain from preaching, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
constantly replied, "If you let me out to-day, I shall
preach again to-morrow." Bunyan, on being liberated,
became pastor of the Baptist Church at Bedford;
and when the kingdom enjoyed more religious
liberty, he enlarged the sphere of his usefulness by
preaching every year in London, where he excited
great attention. On one day's notice, such multitudes
would assemble, that the places of worship
could not hold them. "At a lecture at seven o'clock
in the dark mornings of winter," says one of his
contemporaries, "I have seen about twelve hundred;
and I computed about three thousand that came to
hear him on a Lord's day, so that one-half of them
were obliged to return for want of room."</p>


<h3>LETTSOM'S LIBERATION OF HIS SLAVES.</h3>

<p>Dr. Lettsom, the founder of the Sea-Bathing Infirmary
at Margate, and of the General Dispensary, was
left by his father a property, which happened to consist
almost entirely of a number of slaves on an estate
in Jamaica. When the benevolent doctor went out
to the West Indies to take possession of his inheritance,
he is said to have emancipated every one of
the slaves on his arrival; so that, in the words of his
biographer, "he became a voluntary beggar at the
age of twenty-three." The doctor went afterwards
to Tortola, where, by his practice as a physician, he
amassed a considerable sum of money, with which
he returned to England in 1768, and attained a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
distinguished position among the Metropolitan practitioners.</p>


<h3>CIVIL TO THE PRINCE OF EVIL.</h3>

<p>The devil, in his malignant wrestlings with the
spirits of the righteous, has not always been so energetically
and uncivilly received as by Luther and his
ink-bottle. It is related in all seriousness, that a
minister who "used often to preach for Mr. Huntington,
was talking one Lord's day morning, at Providence
Chapel, about a trial he underwent in his
own parlour, wherein the devil had 'set in' with
his unbelief to dispute him out of some truth that
was essential to salvation. He said he was determined
that the devil should not have his way, and he
therefore 'drew a chair for him, and desired him to
sit down that they might have it out together.' According
to his own account, he gained a great victory
over the empty chair." He did better in his confidence
than Barcena the Jesuit did in the opposite
spirit; who told another of his order that when the
devil appeared to him one night, out of his profound
humility he rose up to meet him, and prayed him to
sit down in his chair, for he was more worthy to sit
there than he!</p>


<h3>"PERKINS' TRACTORS" EXPOSED.</h3>

<p>Faith in the medicinal potency of the properties of
the loadstone was, for centuries after its discovery, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
regular part of many physicians' mental stock-in-trade;
and pulverized magnet was administered in the form
of pills, and potions, and salves, even after Dr. Gilbert,
of Colchester, had in 1660 scientifically ascertained
and published the fact, that when reduced to
powder the loadstone ceases totally to possess its
magnetic properties. The belief in the efficacy of
magnets held its ground much later. Even in 1779
and 1780, the Royal Society of Medicine at Paris
made experiments with the view of precisely ascertaining
the influence of magnets on the human system;
and the conclusion reached was, that they exerted
a healing potency of no contemptible character.
It was about this time that the instruments called
"Perkins' Tractors," which were supposed to be endowed
with magnetic power, came into vogue. Perkins
was an American citizen, from the shrewd State
of Connecticut; and only he could make, and only
he sell, the painted nails, composed of an alloy of
various metals, that were in great demand among
the credulous and the wealthy. For a considerable
time the wonderful tractors attracted and perplexed
everybody; until Dr. Haygarth of Bath, in the following
manner, made it apparent that the efficacy of the
tractors lay not in themselves, but in the mental condition
of the person upon whom they were used:&mdash;"Robert
Thomas, aged forty-three, who had been
for some time under the care of Dr. Lovell, in the
Bristol Infirmary, with a rheumatic affection of the
shoulder, which rendered his arm perfectly useless,
was pointed out as a proper object of trial by Mr. J.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
W. Dyer, apothecary to the house. Tuesday, April
19th, having everything in readiness, I passed through
the ward, and, in a way that he might suspect
nothing, questioned him respecting his complaint. I
then told him that I had an instrument in my pocket
which had been very serviceable to many in his state;
and when I had explained to him how simple it
was, he consented to undergo the operation. In six
minutes no other effect was produced than a warmth
upon the skin, and I feared that this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d'essai</i> had
failed. The next day, however, he told me that 'he
had received so much benefit that it had enabled
him to lift his hand from his knee, which he had in
vain several times attempted on Monday evening, as
the whole ward witnessed.' The tractors I used
being made of lead, I thought it advisable to lay them
aside, lest, being metallic points, the proof against the
fraud might be less complete. Thus much, however,
was proved, that the patent tractors possessed no specific
power independent of simple metals. Two pieces of
wood, properly shaped and painted, were next made
use of; and in order to add solemnity to the farce,
Mr. Barton held in his hand a stop-watch, whilst Mr.
Lax minuted the effects produced. In four minutes
the man raised his hand several inches, and he had
lost also the pain in his shoulder, usually experienced
when attempting to lift anything. He continued to
undergo the operation daily, and with progressive
good effect; for, on the twenty-fifth, he could touch
the mantelpiece. On the twenty-seventh, in the
presence of Dr. Lovell and Mr. J. P. Noble, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
common iron nails, disguised with sealing-wax, were
substituted for the pieces of mahogany before used.
In three minutes he felt something moving from his
arm to his hand, and soon after he touched the board
of rules which hung a foot above the fire-place.
This patient at length so far recovered that he could
carry coals and use his arm sufficiently to help the
nurse; yet, previous to the use of the spurious tractors,
he could no more lift his hand from his knee
than if a hundredweight were upon it, or a nail
driven through it, as he declared in the presence of
several gentlemen. The fame of this case brought
applications in abundance; indeed, it must be confessed,
that it was more than sufficient to act upon
weak minds, and induce a belief that these pieces of
wood and iron were endowed with some peculiar
virtues."</p>

<p>The prosecution and publication of the result of
Haygarth's experiments, led to the downfall of Perkins
and the discredit of the tractors; but it was not
very long before Mesmerism had established a yet
stronger hold on the public credulity, which seems
never to be content, if it is not fooled to the top of
its bent.</p>


<h3>WHITFIELD "IMPROVING" AN EXECUTION IN
EDINBURGH.</h3>

<p>When Whitfield first went to Scotland, he was received
in Edinburgh with a kind of frantic joy by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
many of the citizens. The day after his arrival, an
unhappy man, who had forfeited his life to the
offended laws of his country, was to be executed.
Mr. Whitfield mingled in the crowd on the occasion,
and seemed highly pleased with the solemnity and
decorum with which the awful scene was conducted.
His appearance, however, drew the eyes of all around
him, and raised a variety of opinions as to his motives.
The next day being Sunday, he preached to a very
large congregation in a field near the city. In the
course of his sermon, he adverted to the execution
which had taken place on the preceding day. "I
know," said he, "that many of you will find it difficult
to reconcile my appearance yesterday with my
character. Many of you, I know, will say that my
moments would have been better employed in praying
for the unhappy man than in attending him to
the fatal tree, and that perhaps curiosity was the
only cause that converted me into a spectator on that
occasion. But those who ascribe that uncharitable
motive to me, are under a mistake. I went as an
observer of human nature, and to see the effect that
such an example would have on those who witnessed
it. I watched the conduct of almost every one present
on that awful occasion, and I was highly pleased
with their demeanour, which has given me a very
favourable opinion of the Scottish nation. Your
sympathy was visible on your countenances, and reflected
the goodness of your hearts, particularly when
the moment arrived that your unhappy fellow-creature
was to close his eyes on this world for ever; then you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
all, as if moved by one impulse, turned your heads
aside, and wept. Those tears were precious, and will
be held in remembrance. How different was it when
the Saviour of mankind was extended on the cross!
The Jews, instead of sympathizing in His sorrows,
triumphed in them. They reviled Him with bitter
expressions, with words even more bitter than the
gall and vinegar which they handed Him to drink.
Not one of all that witnessed His pains turned His
head aside, even in the last pang. Yes, my friends,
there was one; that glorious luminary (pointing to
the sun) veiled his brightness, and travelled on his
course in tenfold night."</p>


<h3>DR. JOHNSON'S OPINION OF WHITFIELD.</h3>

<p>Boswell informs us that Dr. Johnson would not
allow much merit to Whitfield's oratory. "His popularity,
Sir," said he, "is chiefly owing to the peculiarity
of his manner. He would be followed by
crowds were he to wear a nightcap in the pulpit, or
were he to preach from a tree." And again: "Whitfield
never drew as much attention as a mountebank
does; he did not draw attention by doing better than
others, but by doing what was strange. Were Astley
to preach a sermon standing upon his head on a
horse's back, he would collect a multitude to hear
him; but no wise man would say he had made a
better sermon for that. I never treated Whitfield's
ministry with contempt; I believe he did good. He
had devoted himself to the lower classes of mankind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and among them he was of use. But when familiarity
and noise claim the praise due to knowledge, art, and
elegance, we must beat down such pretensions."</p>


<h3>DR. WOLCOT ("PETER PINDAR") IN JAMAICA.</h3>

<p>Dr. Wolcot, the patron of Opie, and better known
to fame as "Peter Pindar," practised medicine&mdash;descending
from a family, members of which in several
generations had followed the same profession in Devon
and Cornwall. Sir William Trelawny, when he went
as Governor to Jamaica, took Wolcot out as surgeon
to his household; and there he figured in several
characters&mdash;as grand master of the ceremonies, private
secretary, and chaplain. Whether or not he
ever received regular ordination, it is certain that
Wolcot acted as rector in the colony for some time;
and odd stories of his behaviour as a parish priest
were current among his friends as well as his enemies.
He read prayers and preached when a congregation
presented itself; but that was not oftener than about
every fourth Sunday. He was a capital shot, and,
with his clerk, used to amuse himself with shooting
pigeons. Having shot their way to the church, the
pair were wont to wait ten minutes in the porch for
the arrival of the congregation; at the end of which
time, if nobody appeared, the reverend sportsmen
returned to their amusement. If a few negroes
only presented themselves at the church, the rector
bought them off with a little money; and one old
negro, finding out Wolcot's weakness, after a time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
attended every Sunday, when the rector would address
him: "What do you come here for, blackee?"
"Why, Massa, for to hear your good sermon and
all the prayer ob de church." "Would not a <em>bit</em> or
two do you more good?" "Yes, massa doctor; me
lub prayer much, but me lub money too." The little
transaction would then take place, and the darky
retire grinning; and it is said that this man drew
thus an income from Wolcot for a whole year. When
he returned to England, Wolcot did not succeed in
obtaining a practice, and abandoned both physic
and divinity for satire&mdash;which yielded him a good
income while he lived, and won him fame both with
his own generation and with posterity.</p>


<h3>CHARITY OF ARCHBISHOP TILLOTSON.</h3>

<p>In 1685, Archbishop Tillotson avowed himself a warm
advocate for affording charitable relief to the French
refugees, on the recall of the Edict of Nantes. Dr.
Beveridge, the prebendary of Canterbury, having
objected to reading a brief for this purpose, as contrary
to the rubric, the Archbishop observed to him
roughly, "Doctor, Doctor, charity is above all rubrics."
While Tillotson was in a private station, he
always laid aside two-tenths of his income for charitable
uses; and after his elevation to the mitre, he so
constantly expended all that he could spare of his
annual revenues in acts of beneficence, that the only
legacy which he was able to leave to his family consisted
of two volumes of sermons, the value of which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
however, was such, that the copyright brought not
less than £2500. Of Tillotson it is told that once,
when King William III. complained of the shortness
of his sermon, he replied, "Sire, could I have bestowed
more time upon it, it would not have been so
long."</p>


<h3>DRUBBING-IN RELIGIOUS FEELING.</h3>

<p>Pietro della Valle, "who," says Southey, "could
be amused at the superstition of others," reports that
when the <cite>Ecce Homo</cite> was displayed during a sermon
in the Jesuit church at Goa, the women used to beat
their servants if they did not cry enough to please
them.</p>


<h3>BON-MOTS OF SYDNEY SMITH.</h3>

<p>Sydney Smith was once dining in company with a
French gentleman, who had before dinner indulged
in a number of free-thinking speculations, and ended
by avowing himself a materialist. "Very good soup,
this," said Mr. Smith. "Yes, Sir, it is excellent,"
was the reply. "Pray, Sir, do you <em>believe</em> in a <em>cook</em>?"
inquired Mr. Smith.&mdash;"Do you believe in the apostolical
succession?" inquired one of Smith. "I do,"
he replied; "and my faith in that dogma dates from
the moment I became acquainted with the Bishop of
&mdash;&mdash;, <em>who is so like Judas!</em>"&mdash;In preaching a charity
sermon, Sydney Smith frequently repeated the assertion
that, of all nations, Englishmen were most distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
for their generosity, and the love of their
<em>species</em>. The collection happening to be inferior to
his expectation, provoked him to say, that he had
evidently made a great mistake; for that his expression
should have been, that they were distinguished
for the love of their <em>specie</em>.&mdash;On the departure of
Bishop Selwyn for his diocese, New Zealand, Smith,
when taking his leave of him, said: "Good-bye, my
dear Selwyn; I hope you will not <em>disagree</em> with the
man who eats you!"&mdash;A friend of Smith inquired,
"What is Puseyism?" To which the witty canon
replied: "Puseyism, Sir, is inflexion and genuflexion;
posture and imposture; bowing to the east, and
curtseying to the west."</p>


<h3>THE ORIGIN OF OUR INDIAN COMMERCE.</h3>

<p>It is perhaps not generally known, says Wadd, in his
<cite>Memoirs</cite>, that it was an English surgeon of the name
of Broughton whose good fortune it was to open the
commerce of India to his countrymen, by the following
accident. Having been sent from Surat to Agra
in the year 1636, to treat one of the daughters of
the Emperor Shah Jehan, he had the good fortune
to cure the Princess. By way of recompense, the
Emperor, among other favours, gave him the privilege
of a free commerce throughout the whole extent
of his dominions. Broughton immediately returned
to Bengal, to purchase goods, and transmit them by
sea to Surat. Scarcely had he returned when he
was requested to attend the favourite of the Nabob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of the province, labouring under a very dangerous
disease. Having fortunately restored his patient to
health, the Nabob settled a pension upon him, confirmed
the privilege of the Emperor, and promised
to allow the same to all the English who should come
to Bengal. Broughton communicated all this to the
English Governor at Surat, and it was by the advice
of the latter that the company sent from England,
in 1640, two ships to Bengal. Such was the
origin of a commerce that has since been carried to
so great an extent&mdash;and made the foundation of a
vast empire.</p>


<h3>CHARLES II. AND BISHOP STILLINGFLEET.</h3>

<p>Charles the Second once demanded of Dr. Stillingfleet,
who was a preacher to the Court, "Why he
read his sermons before him, when on every other
occasion his sermons were delivered extempore?"
The Bishop answered, that, overawed by so many
great and noble personages, and in the presence of
his Sovereign, he dared not to trust his powers.
"And now," said the divine, "will your Majesty
permit me to ask a question?" "Certainly," said
the condescending monarch. "Why, then, does
your Majesty read your speeches, when it may be
presumed that <em>you</em> can have no such reason?"
"Why, truly," said the King, "I have asked my
subjects so often for money, that I am ashamed to
look them in the face."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>


<h3>A TOO PERSONAL APPLICATION.</h3>

<p>When Dr. Beadon was rector of Eltham, in Kent, his
text one day was, "Who art thou?" After reading
the text, he made a pause, for the congregation to
reflect upon the words; when a gentleman, in a
military dress, who at the instant was marching
very sedately up the middle aisle of the church,
supposing it a question addressed to him, to the
surprise of all present replied, "I am, Sir, an officer
of the sixteenth regiment of foot, on a recruiting
party here; and having brought my wife and family
with me, I wish to be acquainted with the neighbouring
clergy and gentry." This so deranged the
divine, and astonished the congregation, that though
they attempted to listen with decorum, the service
was not continued without considerable difficulty.</p>


<h3>PREACHING TO PURPOSE.</h3>

<p>Burnet records that "two entries made in the
Council Books, show the good effects of Latimer's
zealous preaching. On the 10th of March he brought
in £104 recovered of one who had concealed it from
the King, and a little after, £363 of the King's
money." The amount of this conscience-money
must of course be multiplied manifold, to estimate
aright the penetrating and persuading power of
the preacher. Latimer's style of preaching is said
to have been extremely captivating; simple and
familiar, often enlivened with anecdote, irony, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
humour; and still oftener swelling into strains of
most impassioned and awakening eloquence. Of the
earnestness of his manner, which could lead to the
disgorgement of great plunder by unscrupulous men,
the following, from a sermon against the corruptions
of the age, may be taken as a sample:&mdash;"Take heed
and beware of covetousness; take heed and beware
of covetousness; take heed and beware of covetousness.
And what if I should say nothing else these
three or four hours but these words? Great complaints
there are of it, and much crying out, and
much preaching, but little amendment that I can
see; Covetousness is the root of all evil. Then
have at the root; out with your swords, ye preachers,
and strike at the root. Stand not ticking
and toying at the branches, for new branches
will spring out again, but strike at the root; and
fear not these great men, these men of power, these
oppressors of the needy&mdash;fear them not, but strike
at the root." In another sermon, Latimer himself
gives some account of the restitutions he brought
about:&mdash;"At my first preaching of restitution, one
man took remorse of conscience, and acknowledged
himself to me that he had deceived the King, and
willing he was to make restitution; and so the first
Lent came to my hands £20 to be restored to the
King's use. I was promised £20 more the same Lent;
but it could not be made, so that it came not. Well,
the next Lent came £320 more. I received it myself
and paid it to the King's council. So I was asked
what he was that made this restitution. But should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
I have named him? Nay, they should as soon have
this weasand of mine. Well, now, this Lent came
£180, 10s. which I was paid, and delivered this present
day to the King's council; and so this man hath
made a godly restitution. And so, quoth I to a certain
nobleman that is one of the King's council, if
every man that hath beguiled the King should make
restitution after this sort, it would cough the King
£20,000 I think, said I. Yea, that it would, quoth
the other, a whole £100,000. Alack! alack! make
restitution for God's sake; ye will cough in hell else,
that all the devils there will laugh at your coughing.
There is no remedy but restitution, open or secret,
or else hell."</p>


<h3>SERVANT AND MASTER.</h3>

<p>A preacher who differed in opinion with Adolphus
Gunn, called upon him, and being known, was denied
admittance, "Mr. Gunn being busy in his study."
"Tell him," said the importunate visitor, "that a
servant of the Lord wishes to speak to him." Gunn
sent back this answer: "Tell the servant of the Lord
that I am engaged with his Master."</p>


<h3>DR. BARROWBY,</h3>

<p>Who lived about the middle of last century, when
canvassing for a post in St. Bartholomew's Hospital,
called upon a grocer in Snow Hill, one of the governors.
The grocer was sitting in his counting-house,
and thence saw the Doctor enter the shop. Knowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
his person, and having little doubt that the object of
his visit was to solicit his vote at the approaching
election, the grocer immediately donned his hat and
spectacles, and greatest parochial consequence, and,
strutting into the shop with an insolent air of patronage,
addressed the Doctor with&mdash;"Well, friend, and
what is your business?" Barrowby promptly and
quietly said, "I want a pound of plums;" and after
the abashed and mortified grocer had weighed them
out and put them up, Barrowby paid for them and
walked off without saying a word. (This story has
been erroneously told of Abernethy.) Of the same
Dr. Barrowby, it is related that an Irish gentleman,
whom the College of Physicians had declined to pass,
called next day on him, and insisted upon fighting
him, as being one of the Censors who had been
the authors of the rejection. Barrowby, who was
small of stature, declined to fight. "I am only the
third Censor," he said, "in point of age; you must
first call out your countryman, Sir Hans Sloane, our
President, and when you have fought him and the
two senior Censors, then I shall be ready to meet
you."</p>


<h3>A DESIRABLE CURE OF SOULS.</h3>

<p>Southey copied the following from Jackson's <cite>Oxford
Journal</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
"NEXT PRESENTATION.

<h3>BEAU NASH'S TREATMENT OF A PRESCRIPTION.</h3>

<p>When Beau Nash was ill, Dr. Cheyne wrote a prescription
for him. Next day the Doctor, coming to
see his patient, asked him if he had followed the prescription.
"No, truly, Doctor," was the answer of
Nash; "if I had I should have broken my neck, for
I threw it out of a two pair of stairs' window."</p>


<h3>PULTENEY'S CURE BY SMALL BEER.</h3>

<p>Mr. Pulteney, afterwards the Earl of Bath, lay
(about 1730) for a long time at Lord Chetwynd's
house of Ingestre, in Staffordshire, sick, very dangerously,
of a pleuritic fever. This illness cost him an
expense of 750 guineas for physicians; and, after all,
his cure was accomplished merely by a draught of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
small beer. Dr. Hope, Dr. Swynsen, and other
physicians from Stafford, Lichfield, and Derby, were
called in, and carried off about 250 guineas of the
patient's money, leaving the malady just where they
found it. Dr. Freind went down post from London,
with Mrs. Pulteney, and received 300 guineas for the
journey. Dr. Broxholm went from Oxford, and received
200 guineas. When these two physicians,
who were Pulteney's particular friends, arrived, they
found his case to be quite desperate, and gave him
over, saying that everything had been done that
could be done. They prescribed some few medicines,
but without the least effect. He was still alive, and
was heard to mutter, in a low voice, "Small beer,
small beer." They said, "Give him small beer, or
anything." Accordingly, a great silver cup was
brought, which held two quarts of small beer; they
ordered an orange to be squeezed into it, and gave it
to him. Pulteney drank off the whole at a draught,
and demanded another. Another cupful was administered
to him; and soon after that he fell into a
profuse perspiration and a profound slumber for
nearly twenty-four hours. In his case the saying
was eminently verified, "If he sleep he shall do
well." From that time forth, he recovered wonderfully,
insomuch that in a few days the physicians
took their leave. The joy over his recovery was diffused
over the whole country; for he was then in the
height of that popularity which, after his elevation
to the peerage, he completely forfeited.</p>

<h3>A WITTY FRENCH PREACHER.</h3>

<p>A French preacher, called Father André, was nicknamed
by his Bishop <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le petit fallot</i> (the little lantern).
Having to preach before the prelate, André determined
to notice this, and took for his text, "Ye are
the light of the world." Addressing himself to the
Bishop, he said, "Vous etês, monseigneur, le grand
fallot de l'église, nous ne sommes que de petits fallots."
Father André, preaching before an Archbishop, perceived
him to be asleep during the sermon, and thought
of the following method to awake him. Turning to
the beadle of the church, he said in a loud voice,
"Shut the doors, the shepherd is asleep, and the
sheep are going out, to whom I am announcing the
word of God." This sally caused a stir in the audience,
which awoke the Archbishop. Being once to announce
a collection for a young lady, to enable her to take
the veil, he said, before the commencement of his
sermon, "Friends, I recommend to your charity a
young lady, who has not enough to enable her to
make a vow of poverty." Preaching during the
whole of Lent in a town where he was never invited
to dine, he said, in his farewell sermon, "I have
preached against every vice except that of good
living&mdash;which, I believe, is not to be found among
you, and therefore needed not my reproach."</p>

<h3>CROMWELL AND RICHARD BAXTER.</h3>

<p>After Cromwell had seized on the government,
Richard Baxter, the celebrated Nonconformist divine,
once preached before the Protector, when he made
use of the following text: "Now, I beseech you,
brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus the Christ,
that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be
no division amongst you; but that ye be perfectly
joined together in the same mind, and in the same
judgment." The discourse on these words was levelled
against the divisions and distractions which then prevailed,
especially in the Church. After the sermon,
Cromwell sent for Mr. Baxter, and made a long and
serious speech to him, about God's providence in the
change of the government, and the great things which
had been done at home and abroad. Mr. Baxter
answered, that it was too condescending in his Highness
to acquaint him so fully with all these matters,
which were above his understanding; but that the
honest people of the land took their ancient monarchy
to be a blessing, and not an evil, and humbly craved
his patience, that he might ask how they had forfeited
that blessing? At this question Cromwell became
angry; he said, "There was no forfeiture; but
God had changed things as it pleased Him;" and
after reviling the Parliament which thwarted him,
and especially by name four or five members who
were particular friends of Mr. Baxter, he dismissed
the worthy divine with signs of great displeasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>


<h3>MESSENGER MONSEY'S DYING JESTS.</h3>

<p>Dr. Messenger Monsey, the great grandfather of
Lord Cranworth (so at least Mr. Jeafferson affirms),
was appointed physician to Chelsea Hospital through
the influence of Godolphin, and, after holding that
office for about half a century, died in his rooms at
Chelsea in 1788, in his ninety-fifth year. The eccentricities
that had characterized his prime continued
to distinguish him to the last. In consequence of his
great age, many intending candidates for the office
went down to Chelsea, in order to contemplate the
various advantages and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">agrémens</i> of the situation,
and observe the progress of the tenacious incumbent
towards final recumbency. Monsey, who was at
once a humorist, and possessed of a sharp eye for
a visitor of this order, one day espied in the College
walks a reconnoitring doctor, whom he thus accosted:
"So, Sir, I find you are one of the candidates to succeed
me." The physician bowed. Monsey proceeded:
"But you will be confoundedly disappointed." "Disappointed!"
exclaimed the physician, with quivering
lips. "Yes," returned Monsey; "you expect to
outlive me; but I can discern from your countenance,
and other concomitant circumstances, that you are
deceiving yourself&mdash;you will certainly die first;
though, as I have nothing to expect from that event,
I shall not rejoice at your death, as I am persuaded
you would at mine." It actually fell out as Monsey
(possibly only by way of a ghastly jest) had foretold;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the candidate lived but a short time. The
Doctor was so diverted with checking the aspiring
hopes of his brethren of the faculty, that whenever
he saw a physician on the look-out, he was not content
till he had gone down to comfort him in the
same manner. He did so to several; and it is very
remarkable&mdash;if it be true, as it is alleged&mdash;that his
predictions were in every case verified. At last the
medical speculators shrank in superstitious alarm
from Chelsea, and left Monsey to die in peace;
indeed, when his death happened, the Minister of
the day was not engaged by a single promise, nor
had he had for some time a single application for the
place of physician to the College. Monsey got out
of his own death as much grim fun as he had out of
the poor prying place-hunters. A few days before
he died, he wrote to Mr. Cruickshanks, the anatomist,
begging to know whether it would suit his convenience
to undertake the dissection of his body, as he
felt that he could not live many hours, and Mr.
Forster, his surgeon, was then out of town. The
dissection was one of the instructions of his eccentric
and rather brutal will; his body was not to be subjected
to the insult of any funeral ceremony, but,
after the surgeon had finished with it, "the remainder
of my carcase may be put into a hole, or
crammed into a box with holes, and thrown into the
Thames." His will was, so far as regards the dissection,
faithfully carried out; Mr. Forster dissected the
body, and delivered a lecture upon it to the medical
students in the theatre of Guy's Hospital. Before he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
had disposed of his body by will in the manner
described, and when he meant to be buried in his
garden, he had written an epitaph eminently characteristic
of his violent cynicism and contempt of
things sacred:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">MONSEY'S EPITAPH, WRITTEN BY HIMSELF.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here lie my old bones; my vexation now ends;<br /></span>

<h3>UNMISTAKEABLE IDENTITY.</h3>

<p>A Reverend Doctor in London was what is usually
termed a popular preacher. His reputation, however,
had been gained not by his drawing largely on
his own stores of knowledge or eloquence, but by
the skill with which he appropriated the thoughts
and language of the great divines who had gone
before him. With fashionable audiences, lightly
versed in pulpit lore, he passed for a miracle of
erudition and pathos. It did, for all that, once
happen to him to be detected in his larcenies. One
Sunday, as he was beginning to amaze and delight
his admirers, a grave old gentleman seated himself
close to the pulpit, and listened with close attention.
The preacher had hardly finished his third sentence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
before the old gentleman muttered, loud enough to
be heard by those near, "That's Sherlock!" The
Doctor frowned, but went on. He had not proceeded
much further, when his tormentor broke out
with, "That's Tillotson!" The Doctor bit his lips
and paused, but, considering discretion the better
part of valour, again proceeded. A third exclamation
of "That's Blair!" however, was too much, and
fairly deprived him of patience. Leaning over the
pulpit, he cried, "Fellow, if you do not hold your
tongue, you shall be turned out!" Without moving
a muscle of his face, the grave old gentleman raised
his head, and, looking the Doctor full in the face,
retorted, "<em>That's his own!</em>"</p>


<h3>WHITFIELD AND THE NEW YORK SAILORS.</h3>

<p>When Whitfield preached before the seamen at New
York, he had the following bold apostrophe in his
sermon:&mdash;"Well, my boys, we have a clear sky, and
are making fine headway over a smooth sea, before
a light breeze, and we shall soon lose sight of land.
But what means this sudden lowering of the heavens,
and that dark cloud arising from beneath the western
horizon? Hark! Don't you hear distant thunder?
Don't you see those flashes of lightning? There is a
storm gathering! Every man to his duty! How
the waves rise, and dash against the ship! The air
is dark! The tempest rages! Our masts are gone!
The ship is on her beam ends! What next?" It is
said that the unsuspecting tars, reminded of former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
perils on the deep, as if struck by the power of
magic, arose with united voices and minds, and
shouted, "<em>Take to the long boat</em>."</p>


<h3>CLEVER PERVERSION OF SCRIPTURE.</h3>

<p>Dr. Williamson, Vicar of Moulton, in Lincolnshire,
had a violent quarrel with one of his parishioners of
the name of Hardy, who showed considerable resentment.
On the succeeding Sunday the Doctor
preached from the following text, which he pronounced
with much emphasis, and with a significant
look at Mr. Hardy, who was present: "There is no
fool like the fool <em>Hardy</em>."</p>


<h3>DR. WASDALE'S LONG RIDE.</h3>

<p>Dr. Wasdale, who originally was an apothecary,
resided at Carlisle when George III. came to the
throne; and as he had some business to transact in
London, he was desirous to see the pageant of the
coronation at the same time. As he was very busy
in his professional engagements at Carlisle, he set
out on a Saturday after the market was over, about
one in the afternoon, and got to London the next
day, Sunday, in the evening, having ridden 301
miles in twenty-eight hours. He left London again
on the following Thursday about noon, and got
home on Friday in the evening. This is perhaps
the greatest equestrian feat in medical annals; and,
for the information of possible rivals, the Doctor left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the memorandum "that he made use of his own
saddle the whole journey." Dr. Wasdale, in the
later part of his life, resided in Spring Gardens, but
did not engage in practice, acting as private secretary
to the Duke of Norfolk.</p>


<h3>ICONOCLASTIC ZEAL IN THE NORTH.</h3>

<p>"The high altar at Aberdeen"&mdash;so we read in Douglas's
<cite>East Coast of Scotland</cite>, published at the end of
last century&mdash;"a piece of the finest workmanship of
anything of the kind in Europe, was hewn to pieces
in 1649, by order of the parish minister. The carpenter
employed for this infamous purpose, struck
with the noble workmanship, refused to lay a tool
on it; till the more than Gothic priest took the
hatchet from his hand, and struck the first blow."
Elsewhere Douglas, who displays a heart hatred of
the image-breakers, remarks that, "so violent was
the zeal of that reforming period against all monuments
of idolatry, that perhaps the sun and moon,
very ancient objects of false worship, <em>owed their safety
to their distance</em>."</p>


<h3>UNCONCERN IN PRESENCE OF DEATH.</h3>

<p>Dr. Woodville, the author of a work on medical
botany, lived in lodgings at a carpenter's house in
Ely Place, London; and a few days before he died,
Dr. Adams brought about his removal, for better
attendance, to the Small-pox Hospital. The carpenter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
with whom he lodged had not been always on
the best terms with him. Woodville said he should
like to let the man see that he died at peace with
him, and, as he never had had much occasion to
employ him, desired that he might be sent for to
come and measure him for his coffin. This was done;
the carpenter came, and took measure of the Doctor,
who begged him not to be more than two days
about it, "for," said he, "I shall not live beyond
that time;" and he actually did die just before the
end of the next day. A contemporary and friend of
his, Dr. George Fordyce, also expired under similar
circumstances. He desired his youngest daughter,
who was sitting by his bedside, to take up a book
and read to him; she read for about twenty minutes,
when the Doctor said, "Stop, go out of the room;
I am going to die." She put down the book, and
went out of the room to call the attendant, who
immediately went into the bedroom and found that
Fordyce had breathed his last.</p>


<h3>AN AGRICULTURAL DEFENCE OF BIGOTRY.</h3>

<p>In Ryder's <cite>History of England</cite>, a singular reason is
stated to have been alleged by the Interlocutor, in
support of a motion he had made in Convocation
against permitting the printing of Cranmer's translation
of the Bible. "If," said the mover, "we
give them the Scriptures in their vernacular tongue,
what ploughman who has read that 'no man having
set his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
for the kingdom of heaven,' will thenceforth make a
straight furrow?"</p>


<h3>PURITAN RECHRISTENING OF PLAYING CARDS.</h3>

<p>The Puritans objected to the use of "heathen"
names, not only for children, but for the "court"
cards of the pack. They complained, according to
Collier, of the appellations of Hercules, Alexander,
Julius Cæsar, Hector, and such like; and they
wanted to have the Kings called David, Solomon,
Isaiah, and Hezekiah; the Queens, Sarah, Rachel,
Esther, and Susannah; the Knaves, Balak, Achitophel,
Tobit, and Bel. There was, however, it must
be confessed, considerable toleration in their permitting
the use of cards at all.</p>


<h3>JOHN HUNTER THE ANATOMIST.</h3>

<p>Wadd, in his interesting collection of medical <cite>Mems.,
Maxims, and Memoirs</cite>, says of John Hunter:&mdash;"When
Hunter began practice, the town was in possession
of Hawkins, Bromfield, Sharpe, and Pott; whilst
Adair and Tomkins had the chief practice derived
from the army. He remained in unenvied obscurity
for many years; and so little was he considered, that
some time after he began lecturing his class consisted
of less than twenty. Dr. Denman used to say that
William Hunter was a man of order, and John Hunter
a man of genius; and, in truth, with all his cleverness,
which was more than ordinary, the Doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
always felt John's superiority. 'In this I am only
my brother's interpreter.' 'I am simply the demonstrator
of this discovery; it was my brother's'&mdash;were
his constant expressions. Hunter was a philosopher
in more senses than one: he had philosophy
enough to bear prosperity as well as adversity, and
with a rough exterior was a very kind man. The
poor could command his services more than the rich.
He would see an industrious tradesman before a
duke, when his house was full of grandees. 'You
have no time to spare,' he would say; 'you live by
it: most of these can wait; they have nothing to do
when they go home.' No man cared less for the
profits of the profession, or more for the honour of
it. He cared not for money himself, and wished the
Doctor to estimate it by the same scale, when he sent
a poor man with this laconic note:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Dear Brother</span>,&mdash;The bearer wants your advice.
I do not know the nature of the case. He has no
money, and you have plenty, so you are well met.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<p class="sig">
'<span class="smcap">J. Hunter</span>.'
</p></blockquote>

<p>He was once applied to, to perform a serious operation
on a tradesman's wife; the fee agreed upon was
twenty guineas. He heard no more of the case for
two months, at the end of which time he was called
upon to perform it. In the course of his attendance
he found out that the cause of the delay had been
the difficulty under which the patient's husband had
laboured to raise the money; and that they were
worthy people, who had been unfortunate, and were
by no means able to support the expense of such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
affliction. 'I sent back to the husband nineteen
guineas, and kept the twentieth,' said he, 'that they
might not be hurt with an idea of too great an obligation.
It somewhat more than paid me for the expense
I had been at in the business.' He held the
operative part of surgery in the lowest estimation.
'To perform an operation,' said he, 'is to mutilate
the patient whom we are unable to cure; it should
therefore be considered as an acknowledgment of the
imperfection of our art.' Among other characteristics
of genius, was his simplicity of character and
singleness of mind. His works were announced as
the works of <i>John Hunter</i>; and <i>John Hunter</i> on a
plain brass plate announced his residence. His honour
and his pride made him look with contempt on
the unworthy arts by which ignorant and greedy
men advance their fortunes. He contemplated the
hallowed duties of his art with the feelings of a
philanthropist and a philosopher; and although surgery
had been cultivated more than 2000 years, this
single individual did more towards establishing it as a
<em>science</em>, than all who preceded him."</p>


<h3>LORD BACON ON THE REVIVAL OF
"PROPHESYING."</h3>

<p>Lord Bacon, in his <cite>Inquiry on the Pacification of the
Church</cite>, asks whether it might not be advantageous
to renew the good service that was practised in the
Church of England for some years, and afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
put down, against the advice and opinion of one of
the greatest and gravest prelates of the land. The
service in question was commonly called "prophesying;"
and from this description of it by Bacon it may
be seen that it might have benefits of its own, not in
the Church of England alone or especially, if it were
resumed at the present day:&mdash;"The ministers within
a precinct did meet upon a week-day in some principal
town, where there was some ancient grave minister
that was president, and an auditory admitted of
gentlemen, or other persons of leisure. Then every
minister successively, beginning with the youngest,
did handle one and the same part of Scripture, spending
severally some quarter of an hour or better, and
in the whole, some two hours; and so the exercise
being begun and concluded with prayer, and the president
giving a text for the next meeting, the assembly
was dissolved; and this was, as I take it, a fortnight's
exercise, which in my opinion was the best way to
frame and train up preachers to handle the word of
God as it ought to be handled, that hath been practised.
For we see orators have their declamations;
lawyers have their merits; logicians their sophisms;
and every practice of science hath an exercise of erudition
and imitation before men come to the life; only
preaching, which is the worthiest, and wherein it is
most dangerous to do amiss, wanteth an introduction,
and is ventured and rushed upon at first."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>


<h3>DR. DONNE'S PRAYERFUL PUN.</h3>

<p>Dr. Donne, the Dean of St. Paul's, having married a
lady of a rich and noble family without the consent
of the parents, was treated with great asperity. Having
been told by the father that he was to expect no
money from him, the Doctor went home and wrote
the following note to him: "John Donne, Anne
Donne, <em>undone</em>." This quibble had the desired effect,
and the distressed couple were restored to favour.</p>


<h3>PREPARING FOR THE WORST AND BEST.</h3>

<p>The historians of dissent record with pride the sedulous
preparation of Dr. Marryat, a tutor who belonged
to the Independent body, to make the best of either
of the worlds to come. He was accustomed, we are
told, to sit up at his studies two or three nights in the
week, the whole year over. He learned by heart, at
these times, the poets and prophets of the Old Testament,
the Epistles and Apocalypse of the New; and
what he had thus acquired, he sought to retain by
careful recitation of them annually. He had begun
to do this while he was yet a young man; when,
"deeply convinced of his sinfulness and misery, he
was afraid of falling into hell, and formed the resolution
that if that should be the case, he would treasure
up in his mind as much of the word of God as he
possibly could, and carry it with him to the place of
torment. When faith in his Redeemer afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
communicated to his soul the peace and consolations
of the gospel, he still continued the practice, that
he might have a larger measure to carry to a better
place."</p>


<h3>GEORGE CRABBE, THE APOTHECARY POET.</h3>

<p>Not the least distinguished among the names of doctors
who have distinguished themselves in the world
of literature, is that of George Crabbe. He was the
son of the collector of salt dues at Aldborough, in
Suffolk, where he was born on Christmas Eve, 1754.
His father strove to give his children an education
somewhat above their station in life; and George was
kept at school at Bungay and Stowmarket till his
fourteenth year&mdash;his comparative delicacy of constitution
inducing his father to destine him to a gentler
pursuit than those followed by his brothers. Leaving
school, he was apprenticed to a country doctor, half
farmer half physician, at Wickham Brook, near Bury
St. Edmunds, where he shared the bed of his master's
stable-boy. This and other <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">désagrémens</i> of the situation,
however, did not suit Crabbe's likings or his
father's honest pride; and in a couple of years he was
removed, and placed with Mr. Page, a surgeon at
Woodbridge, and a gentleman of family and taste.
Here he found time and circumstances favouring to
make his first essays in poetry; and in 1775 published
his first work of consequence, <cite>Inebriety, a
Poem: in three parts</cite>. At the expiry of his apprenticeship,
Crabbe vainly tried to raise funds for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
regular course of study in London, and had to content
himself with settling down in his native village
in a small practice as surgeon and apothecary; but
this proving an insufficient source of income, he resolved
to venture his fortunes in London, in dependence
on his poetic talent. "With this view he
proceeded to London; and after a year spent in that
most trying of all situations, that of a literary adventurer
without money and without friends&mdash;a situation
from the miseries of which the unfortunate Chatterton,
'the wondrous boy,' escaped by suicide&mdash;when on the
point of being thrown into jail for the little debts which
he had unavoidably contracted, as a last resource,
in an auspicious moment, he had applied to Edmund
Burke for assistance, transmitting to him at the same
time some verses as a specimen of his abilities. In
these sketches Burke at once recognised the hand of
a master. He invited the poet to Beaconsfield; installed
him in a convenient apartment; opened up to
him the stores of his library; watched over his progress,
and afforded him the benefit of his taste and
literary skill." "The Library" soon appeared, and
Crabbe was famous. By Burke's advice he went into
holy orders; he was appointed chaplain to the household
of the Duke of Rutland, obtained ample Church
preferment, and pursued his path to fame.</p>


<h3>THE WAY TO PROMOTION.</h3>

<p>Speed relates that Guymond, chaplain to Henry I.,
observing that for the most part ignorant men were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
advanced to the best dignities of the Church, one day,
as he was celebrating divine service before the King,
and was about to read these words out of St. James,
"It rained not upon the earth iii years and vi months,"
read it thus: "It rained not upon the earth one-one-one
years and five-one months." The king noticed
the singularity, and afterwards took occasion to blame
the chaplain for it. "Sire," answered Guymond, "I
did it on purpose, for such readers, I find, are sooner
advanced by your Majesty." The King smiled; and
in a short time thereafter presented Guymond to the
benefice of St. Frideswid's, in Oxford.</p>


<h3>BOLD APPLICATION OF BOURDALOUE.</h3>

<p>Louis Bourdaloue&mdash;who claims the proud distinction
of being "the reformer of the pulpit and the
founder of genuine pulpit eloquence in France"&mdash;was
sent for by Louis XIV. to preach the Advent
Sermon in 1670. Bourdaloue, at that time at the
age of thirty-eight, acquitted himself before the
Court with so much success, that he was for many
years afterwards retained as a preacher at Court. He
was called the King of Preachers, and the Preacher to
Kings; and Louis himself said, that he would rather
hear the repetitions of Bourdaloue, than the novelties
of another. With a collected air, he had little action;
he kept his eyes generally half closed, and penetrated
the hearts of his hearers by the tones of a voice uniform
and solemn. On one occasion he turned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
peculiarity of his external aspect to account in a very
memorable fashion. After depicting in soul-awakening
terms a sinner of the first magnitude, he suddenly
opened his eyes, and, casting them full on the King,
who sat opposite to him, he cried in a voice of thunder,
"Thou art the man!" The effect was magical,
confounding. When Bourdaloue had made an end of
his discourse, he immediately went, and, throwing
himself at the feet of his Sovereign, said, "Sire, behold
at your feet one who is the most devoted of your
servants; but punish him not, that in the pulpit he
can own no other master than the King of kings!"
This incident was characteristic of Bourdaloue's style
of preaching, for he gave his powers to attacking the
vices, passions, and errors of mankind. In his later
days he renounced the pulpit, and devoted himself
to the care of hospitals, prisons, and religious institutions.
He died in 1704; and his sermons have been
translated into several tongues.</p>


<h3>GARRICK'S PRECEPTS FOR PREACHERS.</h3>

<p>The celebrated actor Garrick having been requested
by Dr. Stonehouse to favour him with his opinion as
to the manner in which a sermon ought to be delivered,
sent him the following judicious answer:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Pupil</span>,&mdash;You know how you would feel
and speak in a parlour concerning a friend who was
in imminent danger of his life, and with what energetic
pathos of diction and countenance you would
enforce the observance of that which you really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
thought would be for his preservation. You could
not think of playing the orator, of studying your
emphases, cadences, and gestures; you would be
yourself; and the interesting nature of your subject

<h3>GEORGE II. AS AN AMATEUR SURGEON.</h3>

<p>It is related in the <cite>Percy Anecdotes</cite>, that a gentleman,
after taking tea with a friend who lived in St.
James's Palace, took his leave, and stepping back,
immediately fell down a whole flight of stairs, and
with his head broke open a closet door. The unlucky
visitor was completely stunned by the fall; and on
his recovery, found himself sitting on the floor of a
small room, and most kindly attended by a neat little
old gentleman, who was carefully washing his head
with a towel, and fitting with great exactness pieces
of sticking plaster to the variegated cuts which the
accident had occasioned. For some time his surprise
kept him silent; but finding that the kind physician
had completed his task, and had even picked up his
wig, and replaced it on his head, he rose from the
floor, and limping towards his benefactor, was going
to utter a profusion of thanks for the attention he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
had received. These were, however, instantly checked
by an intelligent frown, and significant motion of
the hand towards the door. The patient understood
the hint, but did not then know that for the kind
assistance he had received he was indebted to George
II., King of England.</p>


<h3>BLUNDERS OF BLOOD-LETTERS.</h3>

<p>A noble fee, in the interests of humanity, was given
by a French lady to a surgeon, who used his lancet
so clumsily that he cut an artery instead of a vein, in
consequence of which the lady died. On her deathbed
she made a will, bequeathing the operator a life
annuity of eight hundred livres, on condition "that
he never again bled anybody so long as he lived."</p>

<p>In the <cite>Journal Encyclopédique</cite> of May 1773, a somewhat
similar story is told of a Polish princess, who
lost her life in the same way. In her will, made <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
extremis</i>, there was the following clause:&mdash;"Convinced
of the injury that my unfortunate accident
will occasion to the unhappy surgeon who is the
cause of my death, I bequeath to him a life annuity
of two hundred ducats, secured by my estate, and
forgive his mistake from my heart. I wish this may
indemnify him for the discredit which my sorrowful
catastrophe will bring upon him."</p>

<p>A famous French Maréchal reproved the awkwardness
of a phlebotomist less agreeably. Drawing himself
away from the operator, just as the incision was
about to be made, he displayed an unwillingness to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
put himself further in the power of a practitioner
who, in affixing the fillet, had given him a blow with
the elbow in the face. "My Lord," said the surgeon,
"it seems that you are afraid of the bleeding."
"No," returned the Maréchal, "not of the bleeding&mdash;but
the bleeder."</p>


<h3>BISHOPS AND THE POOR.</h3>

<p>A nobleman once advising a French bishop to add to
his house a new wing in modern style, received this
answer:&mdash;"The difference, my Lord, between your
advice and that which the devil gave to our Saviour
is, that Satan advised Jesus to change the stones into
bread, that the poor might be fed&mdash;and you desire
me to turn the bread of the poor into stones!"</p>

<p>Ethelwold, Bishop of Winchester in the time of
King Edgar, sold the sacred gold and silver vessels
belonging to the Church, to relieve the poor during a
famine,&mdash;saying that there was no reason that the
senseless temples of God should abound in riches,
while his living temples were perishing of hunger.</p>

<p>Butler, Bishop of Durham, being asked for a charitable
subscription, asked his steward what money he
had in the house. The steward informed him that
there were five hundred pounds. "Five hundred
pounds!" cried the bishop; "it is a shame for a
bishop to have so much in his possession!" and he
ordered the whole sum to be immediately given to
the poor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>


<h3>BISHOP BURNET AGAINST PLURALITIES.</h3>

<p>Bishop Burnet, in his charges to the clergy of his
diocese, used to be extremely vehement in his exclamations
against pluralities. In his first visitation to
Salisbury, he urged the authority of St. Bernard;
who, being consulted by one of his followers whether
he might accept of two benefices, replied, "And
how will you be able to serve them both?" "I
intend," answered the priest, "to officiate in one of
them by a deputy." "Will your deputy suffer eternal
punishment for you too?" asked the saint. "Believe
me, you may serve your cure by proxy, but you
must suffer the penalty in person." This anecdote
made such an impression on Mr. Kelsey, a pious and
worthy clergyman then present, that he immediately
resigned the rectory of Bemerton, in Berkshire, worth
£200 a year, which he then held with one of greater
value.</p>


<h3>ABERNETHY CONQUERED BY CURRAN.</h3>

<p>To curb his tongue, out of respect to Abernethy's
humour, was an impossibility to John Philpot Curran.
Eight times Curran (who was personally unknown to
Abernethy) had called on the great surgeon; and
eight times Abernethy had looked at the orator's
tongue (telling him that it was the most unclean
and utterly abominable tongue in the world); had
curtly advised him to drink less, and not abuse his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
stomach with gormandizing; had taken a guinea, and
had bowed him out of the room. On the ninth visit,
just as he was about to be dismissed in the same
summary fashion, Curran said, "Mr. Abernethy, I
have been here on eight different days, and I have
paid you eight different guineas, but you have never
yet listened to the symptoms of my complaint. I am
resolved, sir, not to leave the room till you satisfy
me by doing so." With a good-natured laugh, Abernethy
leaned back in his chair and said, "Oh! very
well, sir; I am ready to hear you out. Go on, give
me the whole&mdash;your birth, parentage, and education.
I wait your pleasure. Pray be as minute and tedious
as you can." Curran gravely began:&mdash;"Sir, my name
is John Philpot Curran. My parents were poor, but,
I believe, honest people, of the province of Munster,
where also I was born, at Newmarket, in the county
of Cork, in the year one thousand seven hundred and
fifty. My father being employed to collect the rents
of a Protestant gentleman of small fortune, in that
neighbourhood, procured my admission into one of
the Protestant free schools, where I obtained the first
rudiments of my education. I was next enabled to
enter Trinity College, Dublin, in the humble sphere
of a sizar&mdash;." And so he went steadily on, till he had
thrown Abernethy into convulsions of laughter.</p>


<h3>WITTICISMS OF ARCHBISHOP WHATELY.</h3>

<p>"What is the difference," asked Archbishop Whately
of a young clergyman he was examining, "between a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
form and a ceremony? The meaning seems nearly the
same; yet there is a very nice distinction." Various
answers were given. "Well," he said, "it lies in
this: you sit upon a <em>form</em>, but you stand upon <em>ceremony</em>."</p>

<p>"Morrow's Library" is the Mudie's of Dublin, and
the Rev. Mr. Day a popular preacher. "How inconsistent,"
said Archbishop Whately, "is the piety of
certain ladies here! They go to <em>Day</em> for a sermon,
and to <em>Morrow</em> for a novel!"</p>

<p>At a dinner-party Archbishop Whately called out
suddenly to the host: "Mr. &mdash;&mdash;!" There was silence.
"Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, what is the proper female companion of
this John Dory?" After the usual number of guesses
the answer came: "<em>Anne Chovy.</em>"</p>


<h3>WHITFIELD AND THE KINGSWOOD COLLIERS.</h3>

<p>The crowds that attended the preaching of Whitfield,
first suggested to him the thought of preaching in the
open air. When he mentioned this to some of his
friends, they judged it was mere madness; nor did he
begin to practise it until he went to Bristol, when,
finding the churches denied to him, he preached on a
hill at Kingswood to the colliers. After he had done
this three or four times, his congregation is said to
have amounted to twenty thousand persons. He
effected a great moral reform among these colliers
by his preaching. "The first discovery," he tells us,
"of their being affected, was to see the white gutters
made by their tears, which plentifully fell down their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
black cheeks, as they came out of their coal-pits."
After this he preached frequently in the open air in
the vicinity of London, and in other parts of the
country, to thousands of auditors.</p>


<h3>SIR HANS SLOANE.</h3>

<p>This illustrious physician, President of the Royal
Society and the College of Physicians, and the founder
of the British Museum, was born at Killaleagh, in the
north of Ireland, in 1660. He settled in London in
1684, and was in great repute as a practitioner in the
time of Radcliffe, with whom he was acquainted,
though they were never friends. On his arrival in
London, he waited on Sydenham with a letter of
introduction, in which a friend had set forth his
qualifications in glowing language, as "a ripe scholar,
a good botanist, a skilful anatomist." Sydenham read
the recommendation, and eyed the young man very
narrowly; then he said, "All this is mighty fine, but
it won't do. Anatomy&mdash;botany&mdash;nonsense! Sir, I
know an old woman in Covent Garden who understands
botany better; and as for anatomy, my butcher
can dissect a joint just as well. No, no, young man,
this is all stuff; you must go to the bedside,&mdash;it is there
alone that you can learn disease." In spite of this
mortifying reception, however, Sydenham afterwards
took the greatest interest in Sloane, frequently making
the young man accompany him in his chariot on his
favourite airing. It was against the strongly expressed
wish of Sydenham that Sloane went to Jamaica&mdash;where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
he gathered abundant materials for the book
on the natural history of that island, which he published
at intervals from 1707 till 1725. He neglected,
when he was settled in successful practice in London,
no means that could advance the interests of literature
and science. He presented to the Apothecaries'
Company the fee-simple of their gardens, on conditions
as honourable to their fame as to his own. It
was his public spirit and humanity that suggested the
plan of the "Dispensary," the opposition to which
gave rise to the beautiful and famous poem of Garth,
which alone preserves the memory of the contest and
the disputants on this much-vexed subject. Sloane
was made a baronet in 1716; but his greatest glory
was his succession to Sir Isaac Newton in the Presidency
of the Royal Society. Sloane had previously
acted as secretary; and an evidence is given of the
high sense entertained by that body for his services
and his virtues, by their expulsion of Dr. Woodward
from the council, for affronting him by making
grimaces, and by interrupting him, while reading a
paper of his own composition, with a grossly insulting
remark. Sir Isaac Newton was in the chair when the
expulsion of Woodward came under discussion; and
some one pleading in his favour that he was a good
natural philosopher, Newton interfered with the
remark, that "in order to belong to that Society, a
man ought to be a good moral philosopher as well as
a good natural one." In 1746 Sloane retired from
practice; and in 1748 he was visited by the Prince
of Wales, the father of George III., who went to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
a collection and library that were the ornament of
the nation. The Prince duly estimated the value and
excellence of the collection, and at the same time remarked
"how much it must conduce to the benefit of
learning, and how great an honour must redound to
Britain, to have it established for public use to the
latest posterity." It is probable that by this time the
intention of Sir Hans to bequeath his collection to the
nation had transpired; at all events, when he died,
in 1752, it was found by his will that his collections,
which had cost £50,000, and included 50,000 books
and manuscripts, had been left to the nation, on condition
of the payment of £20,000 to his heirs. Parliament
voted £100,000 to fulfil the bargain and
increase the collection; and in 1759 the British
Museum, founded on Sir Hans Sloane's bequest, was
first opened at Montague House. Sir Hans had the
reputation of being one of the most abstemious and
parsimonious of eminent physicians&mdash;his absorbing love
for his museum forbidding us to blame or sneer at a
failing from which the country reaped such splendid
fruit. He is said to have given up his winter soirees
in Bloomsbury Square, to save the tea and bread and
butter he had to dispense to the guests. At one of
the latest of these entertainments, Handel was present,
and gave grave offence to the scientific baronet
by laying a muffin on one of his books. "To be sure
it was a gareless trick," said the composer, a little
brutally, when telling the story, "bud it tid no
monsdrous mischief; bud it pode the old poog-vorm
treadfully oud of sorts. I offered my best apologies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
bud the old miser would not have done with it. If it
had been a biscuit it would not have mattered; but
muffin and pudder! And I said, 'Ah, mine Gotd,
that is the rub!&mdash;it is the pudder!' Now, mine worthy
friend, Sir Hans Sloane, you have a nodable excuse,
you may save your doast and pudder, and lay it to
that unfeeling gormandizing German; and den I
knows it will add something to your life by sparing
your burse.'"</p>


<h3>THE REV. ROWLAND HILL,</h3>

<p>While once travelling alone, was accosted by a footpad,
who, by the agitation of his voice and manner,
appeared to be new to his profession. After delivering
to the assailant his watch and purse, curiosity
prompted Mr. Hill to examine him as to the motives
that had urged him to so desperate a course. The
man candidly confessed, that being out of employment,
with a wife and children who were perishing of
want, despair had forced him to turn robber; but that
this was the first act of the kind in which he had been
engaged. Mr. Hill, struck with the apparent sincerity
of the man, and feeling for his distress, gave
his name and address, and asked him to call on him
the next day. The man did so, and was immediately
taken into the service of the humane divine, where
he continued till his death. Nor did Mr. Hill ever
divulge the circumstance, until he related it in the
funeral sermon which he preached on the death of
his domestic. The same clergyman being called to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
visit a sick man, found a poor emaciated creature in
a wretched bed, without anything to alleviate his
misery. Looking more narrowly, he observed that
the man was actually without a shirt, on which Mr.
Hill instantly stripped himself, and forced his own
upon the reluctant but grateful object; then, buttoning
himself up closely, he hastened homewards,
sent all that was needed to relieve the destitute being
he had left, provided medical aid, and had the satisfaction
of restoring a fellow-creature to his family.</p>


<h3>"MAKE THE MOST OF HIM."</h3>

<p>Dr. Moore, the author of <cite>Zeluco</cite>, told the following
little story, which suggests that physicians are not
always disinclined to recoup themselves for their
generosity, by making the rich and foolish pay
through the nose:&mdash;"A wealthy tradesman, after
drinking the Bath waters, took a fancy to try the
effect of the Bristol hot wells. Armed with an introduction
from a Bath physician to a professional
brother at Bristol, the invalid set out on his journey.
On the road he gave way to his curiosity to read the
Doctor's letter of introduction, and cautiously prying
into it read these instructive words: 'Dear sir, the
bearer is a fat Wiltshire clothier&mdash;make the most of
him.'"</p>


<h3>A PACIFIC SHE.</h3>

<p>Sir William Dawes, Archbishop of York, loved a
pun very well. His clergy dining with him for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
first time after he had lost his lady, he told them he
feared they did not find things in so good order as
they used to be in the time of poor Mary; and, looking
extremely sorrowful, he added with a deep sigh,
"She was, indeed, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mare Pacificum</i>." A curate, who
knew pretty well what the deceased lady had been in
her domestic relations, said, "Aye, my Lord, but
she was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mare Mortuum</i> first!"</p>


<h3>TIME AND ETERNITY.</h3>

<p>When Archbishop Leighton was minister of a parish
in Scotland, the question was asked of the ministers
in their Synod or provincial meeting, whether they
preached the duties of the times. When it was found
that Leighton did not, and he was blamed for his
remissness, he made the answer and defence: "If all
the brethren have preached on the <em>times</em>, may not one
poor brother be suffered to preach on <em>eternity</em>?"</p>


<h3>PHYSICIANS AND CLERGYMEN.</h3>

<p>A peculiar sympathy has always existed between
these two professions, when the second had need of
the first; and the times were, and for some are not
yet past, when the condition of the clergy gave them
a very powerful claim on the generosity of the physicians.
A poor clergyman, settled in London on a
curacy of fifty pounds per annum, with a wife and
numerous family, was known to the good Quaker,
Dr. Fothergill. An epidemic disease seized upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
curate's wife and five children. In his distress he
looked to the doctor for his assistance, but dared not
apply to him, not being able to pay him for his attendance.
A friend, who knew his situation, kindly
offered to accompany him to the Doctor's house, and
give him his fee. They took the advantage of his
hour of audience; and, after a description of the
several cases, the fee was offered, and rejected, but
note was taken of the curate's place of residence.
The Doctor called assiduously the next and every
succeeding day, until his attendance was no longer
necessary. The curate, anxious to return some mark
of the sense he entertained of the Doctor's services,
strained every nerve to accomplish it; but his astonishment
was not to be described, when, instead of
receiving the money he offered, with apologies for
his situation, the Doctor put ten guineas into his
hand, desiring him to apply without diffidence in
future difficulties.&mdash;Dr. Wilson, of Bath, sent a present
of £50 to an indigent clergyman, whom he had
met in the course of practice. The gentleman who
had engaged to convey the gift to the unfortunate
priest, said, "Well, then, I'll take the money to him
to-morrow." "Oh, my dear sir," said the Doctor,
"take it to him to-night. Only think of the importance
to a sick man of one good night's rest!"</p>

<p class="center b15">OPINIONS OF THE PRESS ON THE 'EDINA BURNS.'</p>


<p class="center">The Times.</p>

<p>'The arts of the printer and engraver show to advantage in this
Scotch edition of the Poems and Songs of Burns. The Artists who
supply the Illustrations are all of the land of Burns, and the book
owes nothing to handicraftsmen on this side the Tweed. Many of the
engravings are excellent, particularly the landscape sketches. Altogether
the book is a handsome one, and to the "Scot abroad" it would
be difficult to make a more acceptable present.'</p>


<p class="center">Pall Mall Gazette.</p>

<p>'Mr. Nimmo's illustrated edition of the "Poems and Songs of Robert
Burns" is a book upon which the publisher has evidently bestowed
great care. Limiting himself to the art and industry of his own
country, he has endeavoured to unite Scotland's best draughtsmen,
engravers, and printers in the production of a worthy edition of
Scotland's greatest and dearest poet. The result is very satisfactory.
It is certainly a very meritorious production, and one which does
great credit to the publisher.'</p>


<p class="center">The Examiner.</p>

<p>'Of all the handsome reprints of the works of "nature's own" bard,
this "Edina" edition of the poems and songs of Burns is, perhaps, the
handsomest yet produced. Beautifully printed, and profusely illustrated
by some of the most distinguished of the Scotch academicians,
it forms a shrine worthy of the genius of the "poet of the land of the
mountain and the flood."'</p>


<p class="center">Court Circular.</p>

<p>'If we were asked what is the best and handsomest edition of
Burns extant, we should answer&mdash;and we call the special attention
of the reader to the distinguishing title which the publisher has
affixed to this volume&mdash;the "Edina."'</p>


<p class="center">Saturday Review.</p>

<p>'This is, as it ought to be, a Scotch edition. It is of Scotland,
decidedly Scottish. Scotch as to author, printer, publisher, and illustrator.
The whole thing has a decidedly pretty and whiskyish look;
or, rather, to speak more decorously, it recalls the land of the heather
and the flood throughout.'</p>


<p class="center">Illustrated London News.</p>

<p>'The magnificent "Edina" edition of his works is a noble tribute
rendered to the genius of Burns by the graphic and typographic skill
and taste of Edinburgh, the city which gave him an admiring welcome
in his lifetime, and where his monument has been erected.'</p>


<p class="center">Court Journal.</p>

<p>'If Burns could have lived to see himself in such a jacket of gold
and red as Mr. Nimmo of Edinburgh puts upon him this year, he
would, we think, have shed a tear of gratitude, for pride would have
been foreign to so great a heart.'</p>


<p class="center">Illustrated Times.</p>

passed under our notice within the last few years, but none equal to
the "Edina Burns," just published by Mr. Nimmo.'</p>

<p>'The most brilliant age of Scotland is fortunate in having found a historian
whose sound judgment is accompanied by a graceful liveliness of imagination.
We venture to predict that this book will soon become, and long remain, the
standard History of Scotland.'&mdash;<cite>Quarterly Review.</cite></p>

<p>'An accurate, well-digested, well-written History; evincing deliberation, research,
judgment, and fidelity.'&mdash;<cite>Scotsman.</cite></p>

<p>'The tenor of the work in general reflects the highest honour on Mr. Tytler's
talents and industry.'&mdash;<cite>Sir Walter Scott.</cite></p>

<p>'The want of a complete History of Scotland has been long felt; and from the
specimen which the volume before us gives of the author's talents and capacity
for the task he has undertaken, it may be reasonably inferred that the deficiency
will be very ably supplied. The descriptions of the battles are concise, but full of
spirit. The events are themselves of the most romantic kind, and are detailed in
a very picturesque and forcible style.'&mdash;<cite>Times.</cite></p></blockquote>

<p class="center">I.<br />

NINETY-SIXTH THOUSAND.<br />

Crown 8vo, cloth antique, price 3s. 6d.,<br />

<span class="b12">HEAVEN OUR HOME.</span></p>

<p>'The author of the volume before us endeavours to describe what heaven is, as
shown by the light of reason and Scripture; and we promise the reader many
charming pictures of heavenly bliss, founded upon undeniable authority, and
described with the pen of a dramatist, which cannot fail to elevate the soul as
well as to delight the imagination.... Part Second proves, in a manner as
beautiful as it is convincing, the <span class="smcap">DOCTRINE OF THE RECOGNITION OF FRIENDS IN
HEAVEN</span>,&mdash;a subject of which the author makes much, introducing many touching
scenes of Scripture celebrities meeting in heaven and discoursing of their experience
on earth. Part Third <span class="smcap">DEMONSTRATES THE INTEREST WHICH THOSE IN HEAVEN
FEEL IN EARTH, AND PROVES, WITH REMARKABLE CLEARNESS, THAT SUCH AN INTEREST
EXISTS NOT ONLY WITH THE ALMIGHTY AND AMONG THE ANGELS, BUT ALSO
AMONG THE SPIRITS OF DEPARTED SOULS</span>. We unhesitatingly give our opinion
that this volume is one of the most delightful productions of a religious character
which has appeared for some time; and we would desire to see it pass into extensive
circulation.'&mdash;<cite>Glasgow Herald.</cite></p>

TWENTY-NINTH THOUSAND.<br />

Crown 8vo, cloth antique, price 3s. 6d.,<br />

<span class="b12">MEET FOR HEAVEN.</span></p>

<p>'The author, in his or her former work, "Heaven our Home," portrayed a
<span class="smcap">SOCIAL HEAVEN, WHERE SCATTERED FAMILIES MEET AT LAST IN LOVING INTERCOURSE
AND IN POSSESSION OF PERFECT RECOGNITION</span>, to spend a never-ending
eternity of peace and love. In the present work the individual state of the children
of God is attempted to be unfolded, and more especially the state of probation
which is set apart for them on earth to fit and prepare erring mortals for the
society of the saints.... The work, as a whole, displays an originality of conception,
a flow of language, and a closeness of reasoning rarely found in religious
publications.... The author combats the pleasing and generally accepted belief,
that <span class="smcap">DEATH WILL EFFECT AN ENTIRE CHANGE ON THE SPIRITUAL CONDITION OF
OUR SOULS</span>, and that all who enter into bliss will be placed on a common level.'&mdash;<cite>Glasgow

<p>'This is certainly one of the most remarkable works which have been issued
from the press during the present generation; and we have no doubt it will prove
as acceptable to the public as the two attractive volumes to which it forms an
appropriate and beautiful sequel.'&mdash;<cite>Cheltenham Journal.</cite></p>

<p>'We think this work well calculated to remove many erroneous ideas respecting
our future state, and to put before its readers such an idea of the reality of our
existence there, as may tend to make a future world more desirable and more
sought for than it is at present.'&mdash;<cite>Cambridge University Chronicle.</cite></p>

<p>'This, like its companion works, "Heaven our Home," and "Meet for Heaven,"
needs no adventitious circumstances, no prestige of literary renown, to recommend
it to the consideration of the reading public, and, like its predecessors, will no
doubt circulate by tens of thousands throughout the land.'&mdash;<cite>Glasgow Examiner.</cite></p>

<p>'The work opens up to view a heaven to be prized, and a home to be sought for,

<i>WHEN WE DIE WE DO NOT FALL ASLEEP:<br />
WE ONLY CHANGE OUR PLACE.</i><br />

BY HERBERT BROUGHTON.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</i></p>

<p>'This book will be read by thousands. It treats on all-important
subjects in a simple and attractive style.'&mdash;<cite>Chronicle.</cite></p>

<p>'This is a book of very considerable merit, and destined, ere long,
to attract attention in the literary world. The subject of which it
treats is one of surpassing interest.'&mdash;<cite>Berwick Warder.</cite></p>

<p>'This is a remarkable work, and well worth the study of all inquiring
minds.'&mdash;<cite>Renfrew Independent.</cite></p>

<p>'The last chapter supplies us with a few more instances of the deaths
of pious men, in proof that angels do attend the deathbed scenes of the
saints of God, to carry the disembodied spirit to heaven.'&mdash;<cite>Pall Mall
Gazette.</cite></p>

<p>'The author shows as conclusively as it can be shown, not only that
the soul is an immortal part of our being, but that there are mysterious
links connecting us with those we love on earth, and that when "clothed
upon" with immortality, we shall "recognise each other and be together
in eternity."'&mdash;<cite>Exeter Post.</cite></p>

<p>'We think the author has satisfactorily demonstrated both the
immortality of man, and also that the spirit lives in a condition of
conscious existence after death. His chapter on the recognition of
friends in heaven, proves that point in a convincing manner. His
narratives of the triumphant deathbeds, and the celestial visions of
many departed saints, will be prized by not a few readers.'&mdash;<cite>Dundee

<p>'This is a book for the mourner, and one full of consolation. Even
a heathen poet could say, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non omnis moriar</i>;" and the object of this
book is to show how little of the good man can die, and how thoroughly
the sting of death, deprived of its poison, may be extracted. It is the
work of one who has apparently suffered, and obviously reflected much;
and, having traversed the vale of weeping, offers himself for a guide
to the spots where the springs of comfort flow, and where the sob passes
into the song.... The form and elegance of the book, we must add,
make it peculiarly suitable as a gift.'&mdash;<cite>Daily Review.</cite></p>

<p>In announcing a NEW EDITION of the BORDER TALES, the
Publisher does not consider it necessary to say anything in recommendation
of a work which has stood the test of a general competition, and
which has increased in public favour with its years. Equally suited to
all classes of readers, it has been received with delight in the school-room,
the drawing-room, the parlour, and the village reading-room.
Many of the Tales have been publicly read. The high tone of its
morality renders it an admirable small library for young members of
the family.</p>

<p class="center b15">A BOOK ABOUT DOMINIES:</p>

<p class="center">BEING THE REFLECTIONS AND RECOLLECTIONS OF A MEMBER
OF THE PROFESSION.</p>

<p class="center">John Bull.</p>

<p>'A "Book about Dominies" is the work of no ordinary dominie, who feels the
dignity of his profession, and relates his experience, which is by no means to be
despised. The book merits perusal by all interested in the great question of
Education.'</p>

<p class="center">Bell's Weekly Messenger.</p>

<p>'A more sensible book than this about boys has rarely been written, for it
enters practically into all the particulars which have to be encountered amongst
"the young ideas" who have to be trained for life, and are too often marred by
the educational means adopted for their early mental development. The writer
is evidently one of the Arnold school&mdash;that "prince of schoolmasters"&mdash;who did
more for the formation of the character of his pupils than any man that ever
lived.'</p>

<p class="center">Spectator.</p>

<p>'This is a manly, earnest book. The author describes in a series of essays the
life and work of a schoolmaster; and as he has lived that life, and done that work
from deliberate choice, his story is worth hearing. Why does the writer of a book,
so honest and thoughtful as this about dominies, come before the public anonymously?
Let us hope that a second edition will ere long be called for, and that
